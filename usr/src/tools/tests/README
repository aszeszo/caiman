This directory contains configuration files for Nose, the PyUnit test runner
for the slim_source gate. In order to run the tests you should:

1) Install Nose and the coverage module:
	* Installing the Python setup tools and runtime/python-26/tests
		pkg install library/python-2/setuptools-26
		pkg install runtime/python-26/tests
		pkg install library/python-2/coverage
	* Running the command:
		easy_install-2.6 nose coverage
		(The warning messages during installation may be ignored)

	  Then edit /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/easy-install.pth
          as follows:

          Need to comment out the following line:
	  
          /usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages

          i.e:

	  #/usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages
  
	Note:	As of June 22, 2010, Nose is currently in the JUCR process,
		and may be available from the contrib repository at a
		later date.

2) Build the gate, per the instructions in usr/src/README.
	Note:	The slim_test program will test Python code from
		the proto area, so the associated files must be
		re-built to pick up any changes to tested code.
		The tests themselves are run from the source files,
		so changes to tests do not require a re-build.

3) Use the "bldenv" command to set-up the build and test environment:
	/opt/onbld/bin/bldenv -d ../../developer.sh

There are two different scripts for execution of tests:
  - slim_test
  - slim_regression_test.py (see below for an explanation of this script)

The slim_test script:

The "slim_test" command is a thin wrapper around the "nosetests" command,
and accepts the same arguments. To see a full list of available arguments, run:
	./slim_test -h

Run the following command to execute all the currently known tests:
	./slim_test -c tests.nose

To run an individual test:
        ./slim_test -c tests.nose TEST_NUM [TEST_NUM]...
        
Where TEST_NUM is the number of the test you'd like to run, and may be
specified multiple times to run more than one test. Test numbers are
indicated during a full run. To query the test numbers without executing the
tests, run:
        ./slim_test -c tests.nose --collect-only

Note: To reset the numbering, delete the "usr/src/.noseids" file

To run all tests within a specific file or package, omit the "-c tests.nose"
portion, and supply the path to the file or package, relative to the usr/src
directory of the workspace. For example, the following command runs only
the liberrsvc_pymod tests:
	./slim_test lib/liberrsvc_pymod/test 

To run all tests in a specific file:
	./slim_test lib/liberrsvc_pymod/test/test_liberrsvc.py

To run a specific class of tests in that file:
	./slim_test lib/liberrsvc_pymod/test/test_liberrsvc.py:error_service

To run a particular test in that class:
	./slim_test lib/liberrsvc_pymod/test/test_liberrsvc.py:error_service.test_create_error_info

To report code coverage metrics along with test results, add a "--with-cover"
flag:
	./slim_test -c tests.nose --with-cover

To add a set of tests to the suite, update the tests.nose file. See that
file for more details.

To run the nosexunit test, you will need to do this:

source ${WORKSPACE}/developer.sh
${WORKSPACE}/usr/src/tools/tests/slim_test \
    -c ${WORKSPACE}/usr/src/tools/tests/tests.nose --with-nosexunit \
    --source-folder=${ROOT}/usr/lib/python2.6/vendor-packages --enable-audit \
    --audit-config=${WORKSPACE}/usr/src/tools/env/install.pylintrc

------------------

In addition to the slim_test wrapper, there is also a
slim_regression_test.py script useful for checking your workspace for
regressions.  The slim_regresstion_test.py script requires root permissions
to execute.  The easiest way to set up your system to run these tests as
root is to use sudo.  Before running the regression tests, edit your
/etc/sudoers file (via the visudo command) and set 

Defaults env_keep="PYTHONPATH SRC"

so $SRC and $PYTHONPATH are correctly forwarded to the command being run as
root.

To run all of the tests and check for regressions against the latest Hudson
build:

	sudo ./slim_regression_test.py

To run all of the tests but suppress the printing of the results (useful
for large tests):

	sudo ./slim_regression_test.py --suppress-results

To run a specific subset of tests:

	sudo ./slim_regression_test.py target ai transfer

The list of tests can be found via the --help flag:

	sudo ./slim_regression_test.py --help
