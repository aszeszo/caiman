[nosetests]

# The single line below tells nose where to pick up tests from. It should
# be a comma-separated list of directories. To add a set of tests to
# the suite, simply add an entry to the end of the list. Stand-alone test
# files should be in a "test" sub-directory of the related code, and
# the files in that directory should begin with "test_". Files
# containing in-line doc-tests should be added explicitly.
