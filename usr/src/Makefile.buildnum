# This file has no user serviceable parts.  It is maintained
# automatically by gatekeeper scripts.
#
# If you need to override any value, do not edit it here.  Instead,
# set the values in your build environment.  If you do this, it must
# be an integer, and your choice will have ramifications on whether or
# not the package repositories you build will be upgradeable.
#

#
# Package Version Information
#
# The package version is described in detail within the pkg(5) man page.
# It is made of four components. The values within this file set the
# third component, the branch version, which resides after the dash.
# 
# This component needs to accommodate the following:
#
# o uniquely identifying individual builds to support zone
#   install/update
#
# o for the continued movement forwards when Solaris updates,
#   bug fixes and other requirements are delivered.
#
# The package branch version scheme is:
#
#       trunk_id.update.SRU.platform.buildid
#
# where
#       trunk_id : build number for tip development gate, with leading 0
#       update   : 0 for FCS, 1 for update 1, etc.
#       SRU      : SRU (support repository update) number for this update
#       platform : reserved for future use.
#       buildid  : Build number of SRU, or identifier for development tip
#                  nightlies
#
# This scheme is used below.
#

#
# Generate the trunk id of the packages from the tag in the gate.
# In ON the Nevada builds are tagged with onnv_XXX where XXX is the
# build/trunk number.  slim_source tags are Buildxxx.
#
# When the next development train is started this pattern will need to be
# changed in order to match the tag used there.
#
# With S11 FCS, the TRUNKID is frozen at 175
TRUNKID= 175

#
# The Solaris Update number. This will be set by the gatekeepers.
# The value must match the update number of the release.
#
UPDATENUM= 1

#
# Support Respository Update number. This is here to reserve space within the
# version string. Typically it should not be set unless all the packages
# are being delivered within an SRU.
#
SRUNUM= 0

#
# Platform number. This is here to reserve space within the version
# string. It should not be set unless there is a specific need to
# release a platform update while the Solaris Update is being built.
#
PLATNUM= 0

# Build Identifier. Used to indicate which build (or respin for
# the development build) of the Solaris Update is being built.
# This is set by the gatekeepers.
#
#
# Each (nightly) build of the code that produces packages needs to
# be uniquely identified so that packages produced by different
# builds can't be mixed.  Mixing packages from different builds can
# easily result in broken global and nonglobal zones.
#
# Generate the identifier based upon the tip changeset id.
#
# Note: :sh is used for finding the values because it is evaluated
# once during the package build.
#
OPENCS  :sh = (hg tip --template '{rev}\n')
NIGHTLYID		= $(OPENCS)
