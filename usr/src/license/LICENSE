license. 

(g) Software is copyrighted.

classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available 
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
this distribution.

5. Term and Termination. 

The Agreement is effective on the Date you receive the Software and 
remains effective until terminated.  Your rights under this Agreement 
will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially 
breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its 
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should 
any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, 
the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade 
secret misappropriation.  Upon termination, you will cease use of, and 
destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 
3, 4, 5, and 7-13 will survive termination of the Agreement.

6. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free 
of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for 
the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy and 
Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's 
option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  
Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so 
the above may not apply to you.  This limited warranty gives you 
specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to 
state.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

8. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE 
USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed 
the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.  The foregoing 
limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its 
essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental 
or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be 
applicable to you. 

9. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 

10. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 

11. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
and controlling U.S. federal law.  No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply. 

12. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to 
its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and 
prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification 
of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
authorized representative of each party.

          the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
          with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
          You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
          recipients of any such Covered Software in xecutable form as to
          how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
          reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
          software exchange.

     3.2. Modifications.
     
          The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
          governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
          believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
          You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
          License.

     3.3. Required Notices.

          You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
          identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not

          contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
          or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
          the Initial Developer.

     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

          You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
          Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
          of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
          choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
          indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
          Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
          and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
          must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
          indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
          hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
          Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
          such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
          liability terms You offer.

     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
     
          You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
          under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
          Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
          provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
          and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
          limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
          the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
          Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
          must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
          this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
          Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
          Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
          by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
          such terms You offer.

     3.6. Larger Works.

          You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
          other code not governed by the terms of this License and
          distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
          You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
          for the Covered Software.

     4. Versions of the License.

     4.1. New Versions.

          Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
          publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
          time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
          Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
          steward has the right to modify this License.

     4.2. Effect of New Versions.

          You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
          Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
          License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
          If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
          Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
          available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
          distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
          of the version of the License under which You originally received
          the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
          distribute or otherwise make the
          Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
          version of the License published by the license steward.

     4.3. Modified Versions.

          When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
          license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
          modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
          and remove any references to the name of the license steward
          (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
          (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
          differ from this License.

     5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
     
        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED

        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE

        NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
        UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

     6. TERMINATION.

     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
          cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
          Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
          the termination of this License shall survive.

     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
          judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the
          Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
          claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
          Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
          Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
          Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
          indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
          the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
          under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
          shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
          prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
          notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
          Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
          Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement
          with Participant.

     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
          alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
          license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
          infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
          granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
          taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
          payment or license.

     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all
          end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
          distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
          granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

     7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
     
        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
        FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
        LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
        NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
        SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
        SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
        LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
        EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

     8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined
        in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
        software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. " 252.227-7014(a)
        (1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms
        are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.
        12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those

        necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
        the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
        the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
        provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
        provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
        to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
        venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
        with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
        limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
        The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
        the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
        regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
        construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
        agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
        or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

     10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
        out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
        work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
        responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
        shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

     which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including
     without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may
     be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
     this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of
     this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
     offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
     restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
     hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the
     additional rights described in Section 3.5.
         * 3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or
     to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under
     the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version
     or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you
     made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6)
     months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been
     made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
     the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic
     Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
         * 3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to
     which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to
     create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
     prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
     indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and
     including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b)
     in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which
     You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
         * 3.4 Intellectual Property Matters.
               o (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge
     that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
     required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
     2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
     distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making
     the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
     If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made
     available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify
     the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.
               o (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include
     an application programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge
     of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
     Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
               o (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
     disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that
     Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
     Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
     License.
         * 3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
     each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a
     particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include
     such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would
     be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
     Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice
     described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any
     documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
     ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to
     one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
     own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
     You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
     indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
     agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
     liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property
     claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or
     such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
     terms You offer.
         * 3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered
     Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have
     been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that
     the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
     this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
     the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in
     any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in
     which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
     distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under
     a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this
     License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
     and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit
     or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
     set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a
     different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
     differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
     Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability
     arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code)
     incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
     such terms You offer.
         * 3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
     Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
     distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
     make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
     Code.

     4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible
     for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
     some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or
     regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
     maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
     affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
     Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
     Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description
     must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
     to understand it.
     
     5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the
     Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related
     Covered Code.
     
     6. Versions of the License.

         * 6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the
     "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
     time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
         * 6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published
     under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use
     it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered
     Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
     the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms
     applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
         * 6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this
     License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not
     already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your
     license so that the phrases "Storage Networking Industry Association,"
     "SNIA," or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
     (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
     otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms
     which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the
     Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
     License.)
     
     7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON
     AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
     IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
     FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
     COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
     RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME
     THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
     COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

     8. TERMINATION.
     
         * 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
     breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All
     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
     any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
     remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
         * 8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
     claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
     a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file
     such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
               o (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
     indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
     upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
     within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to
     pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and
     future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
     litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such
     Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
     arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the
     litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You
     under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
     the 60 day notice period specified above.
         * 8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or
     settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then
     the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under
     Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
     or value of any payment or license.
       
         * 8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
     end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
     have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
     termination shall survive termination.

     9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
     THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
     YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
     COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
     PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
     ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
     OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
     NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
     JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
     YOU.

     10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as
     that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
     "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
     documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
     Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
     227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
     with only those rights set forth herein.

     11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning
     subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
     provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
     application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
     International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
     which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
     the drafter shall not apply to this License.

     12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the
     Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
     and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute
     such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

     13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the
     Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the
     Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
     Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

     14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or
     distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                          59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.

       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
     
       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
     
       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.
     
       We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.
     
       Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.
     
       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
     
       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.
     ^L
                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
     
       0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
     
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
     
       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
     
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
     
       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
         part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
         parties under the terms of this License.
     
         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
         a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
         License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
         does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
         the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
     ^L
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
     
         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
         1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
          or,
     
         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
         customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
         received the program in object code or executable form with such
         an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
     ^L
     ^L
       4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.
     
       5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
     
       6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
       7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
     
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.
     
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.
     
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     ^L
       8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     
       9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
     
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
     Software
     Foundation.

       10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     
                            NO WARRANTY

       11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     
       12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     ^L
             Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
     
       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
     
         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.
     
         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.
     
         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
          USA.
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:
     
         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
          w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
     
     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
       `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
       Ty Coon, President of Vice
     
     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

       The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.
    
       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
     
       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.

       We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.
     
       Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.
     
       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
     
       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.
     ^L
                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
     
       0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
     
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
     
       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
     
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
     
       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
         part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
         parties under the terms of this License.
     
         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
         a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
         License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
         does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
         the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
     ^L
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
     
         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
         1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
          or,
     
         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
         customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
         received the program in object code or executable form with such
         an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
     
     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.
     
     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
     ^L
       4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.

       5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
     
       6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
       7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
     
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.
     
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.
     
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     ^L
       8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     
       9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
     
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
     Software
     Foundation.
     
       10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     
                                 NO WARRANTY
     
       11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

       12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
     
                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     ^L
                 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
     
       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
     
       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     
         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.
     
         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.
     
         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
          USA
     
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:
     
         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
          w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
     
     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
       `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
     
       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
       Ty Coon, President of Vice
     
     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.

19)  The following software may be included in this product:

	GHOSTSCRIPT FONTS

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

     Two sets of free fonts are supplied for Ghostscript:

        35 commercial-quality Type 1 basic PostScript fonts -- Times,
        Helvetica, Courier, Symbol, etc. -- contributed by URW++ Design and
        Development Incorporated, of Hamburg, Germany (http://www.urwpp.de/). 
        Fontmap names them all.

        A miscellaneous set including Cyrillic, kana, and fonts derived
        from the free Hershey fonts, with improvements (such as adding
        accented characters) by Thomas Wolff. The Hershey-based fonts are 
        quite different from traditional printer or display fonts; you can 
        read about them in more detail in the documentation on Hershey fonts.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     For the fonts drived from the public domain Hershey fonts with improvements
     by Thoms Wolff as stated by the Hershey.html file delivered with
     GNU Ghostscript:

     USE RESTRICTION:
        This distribution of the Hershey Fonts may be used by anyone for
        any purpose, commercial or otherwise, providing that:
                1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with
                        the font data:
                        - The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.
                                A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.
                                National Bureau of Standards.
                        - The format of the Font data in this distribution
                                was originally created by
                                        James Hurt
                                        Cognition, Inc.

                2. The font data in this distribution may be converted into
                       any other format *EXCEPT* the format distributed by
                        the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights
                        to the distribution and use of the font data in
                        that
                        particular format). Not that anybody would really
                        *want* to use their format... each point is
                        described
                        in eight bytes as "xxx yyy:", where xxx and yyy are
                       the coordinate values as ASCII numbers.

	NETWORK MAPPER SOFTWARE

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

     ***********************IMPORTANT NMAP LICENSE TERMS***********************
     *
     * The Nmap Security Scanner is (C) 1996-2006 Insecure.Com LLC. Nmap is
     * also a registered trademark of Insecure.Com LLC.  This program is free
     * software; you may redistribute and/or modify it under the terms of the
     * GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
     * Foundation; Version 2 with the clarifications and exceptions described
     * below.  This guarantees your right to use, modify, and redistribute
     * this software under certain conditions.  If you wish to embed Nmap
     * technology into proprietary software, we sell alternative licenses
     * (contact sales@insecure.com).  Dozens of software vendors already
     * license Nmap technology such as host discovery, port scanning, OS
     * detection, and version detection.
     *
     * Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derived works", yet
     * it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid
     * misunderstandings, we consider an application to constitute a
     * "derivative work" for the purpose of this license if it does any of the
     * following:
     * o Integrates source code from Nmap
     * o Reads or includes Nmap copyrighted data files, such as
     *   nmap-os-fingerprints or nmap-service-probes.
     * o Executes Nmap and parses the results (as opposed to typical shell or
     *   execution-menu apps, which simply display raw Nmap output and so are
     *   not derivative works.)
     * o Integrates/includes/aggregates Nmap into a proprietary executable
     *   installer, such as those produced by InstallShield.
     * o Links to a library or executes a program that does any of the above
     *
     * The term "Nmap" should be taken to also include any portions or derived
     * works of Nmap.  This list is not exclusive, but is just meant to
     * clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common examples.
     * These restrictions only apply when you actually redistribute Nmap.  For
     * example, nothing stops you from writing and selling a proprietary
     * front-end to Nmap.  Just distribute it by itself, and point people to
     * http://insecure.org/nmap/ to download Nmap.
     *                                                               
     * We don't consider these to be added restrictions on top of the GPL, but 
     * just a clarification of how we interpret "derived works" as it applies
     * to our GPL-licensed Nmap product.  This is similar to the way Linus
     * Torvalds has announced his interpretation of how "derived works"
     * applies to Linux kernel modules.  Our interpretation refers only to
     * Nmap - we don't speak for any other GPL products.
     *
     * If you have any questions about the GPL licensing restrictions on using
     * Nmap in non-GPL works, we would be happy to help.  As mentioned above,
     * we also offer alternative license to integrate Nmap into proprietary
     * applications and appliances.  These contracts have been sold to dozens
     * of software vendors, and generally include a perpetual license as well
     * as providing for priority support and updates as well as helping to
     * fund the continued development of Nmap technology.  Please email
     * sales@insecure.com for further information.
     *
     * As a special exception to the GPL terms, Insecure.Com LLC grants
     * permission to link the code of this program with any version of the
     * OpenSSL library which is distributed under a license identical to that
     * listed in the included Copying.OpenSSL file, and distribute linked
     * combinations including the two. You must obey the GNU GPL in all
     * respects for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify
     * this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file,
     * but you are not obligated to do so.
     *
     * If you received these files with a written license agreement or
     * contract stating terms other than the terms above, then that
     * alternative license agreement takes precedence over these comments.
     *
     * Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a    
     * right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.
     * This also allows you to audit the software for security holes (none   
     * have been found so far).                                               
     *                                                                        
     * Source code also allows you to port Nmap to new platforms, fix bugs,   
     * and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to send your changes  
     * to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation into the main        
     * distribution.  By sending these changes to Fyodor or one the           
     * Insecure.Org development mailing lists, it is assumed that you are     
     * offering Fyodor and Insecure.Com LLC the unlimited, non-exclusive right
     * to reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  Nmap will always be         
     * available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to  
     * relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software 
     * projects (such as KDE and NASM).  We also occasionally relicense the   
     * code to third parties as discussed above.  If you wish to specify      
     * special license conditions of your contributions, just say so when you 
     * send them.                                                             
     *                                                                        
     * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but    
     * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    |               http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpl1.0.txt                  |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    
    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

	PERL SOFTWARE

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following license:

    The "Artistic License"
      Preamble
        The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
        Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
        semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
        giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the
        Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
        reasonable modifications.
    
      Definitions
        "Package"
            refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
            Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
            textual modification.
    
        "Standard Version"
            refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been
            modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
            specified below.
    
        "Copyright Holder"
            is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
    
        "You"
            is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
            Package.
    
        "Reasonable copying fee"
            is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
            charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be
            required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
            computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
    
        "Freely Available"
            means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may
            be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
            of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
            received it.
    
      Conditions
        1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
            Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
            you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
            disclaimers.
    
        2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
            derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
            Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the
            Standard Version.
    
        3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
            provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
            stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
            at least ONE of the following:
    
            a)  place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
                them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
                Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on
                a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the
                Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
                Version of the Package.
    
            b)  use the modified Package only within your corporation or
                organization.
    
            c)  rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
                with standard executables, which must also be provided, and
                provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable
                that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
    
            d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
        4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
            executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
    
            a)  distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
                files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
                equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
    
            b)  accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
                the Package with your modifications.
    
            c)  give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
                document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent),
                together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
    
            d)  make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
    
        5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
            Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
            Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
            you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
            commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
            software distribution provided that you do not advertise this
            Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's
            interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall
            be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
            complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
    
        6.  The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
            output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
            under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
            them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
            Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
            Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing
            a binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
            neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
            fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
            do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
            this Package.
    
        7.  C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
            languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
            emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
            Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
            equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
            not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
            regression tests for the language.
    
        8.  Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
            permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that
            is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
            visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use
            shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
    
        9.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
            promote products derived from this software without specific prior
            written permission.
    
        10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
            WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
            MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

	GRUB SOFTWARE

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following license:

    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    		       Version 2, June 1991
    
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
         59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
    
    			    Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    
    		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
    			    NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
    		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    
    	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
        Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

	AT&T ADVANCED SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY DYNAMIC LINKING LIBRARY (LIBDLL)

    Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following license:

    +------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |          This license covers all software that refers to the URL             |

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

    Common Public License Version 1.0
    
       THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
       PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
       THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
       
       1. DEFINITIONS 
       
       "Contribution" means:
       
         a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
         
         b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
         
         i) changes to the Program, and
         
         ii) additions to the Program;
         
         where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
         and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
         'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
         such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
         behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program
         which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
         conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
         (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
         
       "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
       
       "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
       which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
       alone or when combined with the Program.
       
       "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
       Agreement.
       
       "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
       Agreement, including all Contributors.
       
       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
         license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
         display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative
         works, in source code and object code form.
         
         b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
         grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
         if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
         se is licensed hereunder.
         
         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
         provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
         patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.
         
         d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
         the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
         
       3. REQUIREMENTS
       
       A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
       under its own license agreement, provided that:
       
         a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
         
         b) its license agreement:
         
         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

       2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
       
         a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby

         license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
         import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,

         shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
         if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered
         by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
         other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per

         c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
         licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are

         Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
         brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
         property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
         rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
         assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
         property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
         patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
         before distributing the Program.

         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied
         warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose;
         
         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
         
         iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
         are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;
         and
         
         iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
         exchange.
         
       When the Program is made available in source code form:
       
         a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
         
         b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
         Program.
         
       Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
       within the Program.
       
       Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
       Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
       Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
       
       4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
       
       Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
       responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
       like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
       of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
       commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
       create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
       Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
       such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
       and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
       against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
       from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
       against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
       or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
       distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
       obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
       relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
       In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
       notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
       allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the
       Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
       negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
       claim at its own expense.
       
       For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
       product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
       Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
       claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
       claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
       alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
       defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
       performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
       Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
       must pay those damages.
       
       5. NO WARRANTY
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
       PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
       WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
       OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
       responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
       distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
       exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
       the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
       laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
       unavailability or interruption of operations.
       
       6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY 
       
       EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
       ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
       INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
       WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
       LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
       NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
       DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
       HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
       
       7. GENERAL
       
       If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
       the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
       action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
       
       If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
       respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
       counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
       Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
       of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
       institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
       itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
       hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
       rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
       litigation is filed.
       
       All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
       fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
       Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
       time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
       rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
       and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
       However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
       granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
       survive.
       
       Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
       but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
       may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
       reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
       this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
       Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
       Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
       Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
       the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
       Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
       the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
       after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
       elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
       the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
       above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
       property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
       by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
       expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
       
       This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
       the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
       party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
       more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
       its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
     software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
     General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
     Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
     using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
     the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
     your programs, too.

       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
     
       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
     
       For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
     gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
     you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
     source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
     rights.
     
       We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
     distribute and/or modify the software.
     
       Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
     authors' reputations.
     
       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
     program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
     program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
     patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
     
       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.
     ^L
                         GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
     
       0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
     a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
     refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
     means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
     that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
     either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
     the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
     
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
     Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
     
       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
     
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
     
       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
         part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
         parties under the terms of this License.
     
         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
         notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
         a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
         License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
         does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
         the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
     ^L
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Program.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
       3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
     
         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
         1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
          or,
     
         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
         cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
         customarily used for software interchange; or,
     
         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
         to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
         allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
         received the program in object code or executable form with such
         an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
     code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
     control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
     special exception, the source code distributed need not include
     anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
     form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
     operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
     itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
     ^L
     ^L
       4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.
     
       5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
     
       6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     
       7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
     
     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
     circumstances.
     
     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.
     
     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     ^L
       8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
     may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
     those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
     countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
     the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
     
       9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
     of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
     be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.
     
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
     later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
     either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
     this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
     Software
     Foundation.

       10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
     to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
     Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
     make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
     of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
     of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
     
                            NO WARRANTY

       11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
     FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
     OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
     PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
     OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     
       12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
     INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
     OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
     TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
     YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     ^L
             Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
     
       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
     
         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.
     
         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU General Public License for more details.
     
         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
         along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
         Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
          USA.
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
     when it starts in an interactive mode:
     
         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
          w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
         under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
     
     The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
     parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
     be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
     mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
       `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
     proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
     consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
     library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
     Public License instead of this License.
     


     		GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

    [This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
     numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

                            Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
     Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
     free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

       This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
     specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
     other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
     your libraries, too.
     
       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
     
       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
     you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

       For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
     or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
     you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
     code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
     complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
     with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
     it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

       Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
     the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
     permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
     
       Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
     library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
     version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
     the original authors' reputations.
     ^L
       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
     software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
     transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
     we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
     free use or not licensed at all.
     
       Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
     GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
     license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
     designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
     one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
     the same as in the ordinary license.
     
       The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
     they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
     program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
     changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
     analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
     a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
     derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
     treats it as such.
     
       Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
     Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
     sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
     concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
     
       However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
     users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
     libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
     permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
     preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
     libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
     this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
     changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
     will lead to faster development of free libraries.
     
       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
     "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
     former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
     works together with the library.
     
       Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
     General Public License rather than by this special one.

       0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
     party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
     General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
     addressed as "you".
     
       A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
     
       The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
     straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)
     
       "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
     all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
     interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
     and installation of the library.
     
       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
     such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
     on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
     writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
     and what the program that uses the Library does.
     
       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
     you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
     all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
     Library.
     
       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
     fee.
     ^L
       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     
         a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
     
         b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     
         c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
         charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
     
         d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
         table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
         the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
         is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
         in the event an application does not supply such function or
         table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
         its purpose remains meaningful.
     
         (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
         a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
         application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
         application-supplied function or table used by this function must
         be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
         root function must still compute square roots.)
     
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
     it.
     
     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
     collective works based on the Library.
     
     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
     with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
     the scope of this License.
     
       3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
     this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
     that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
     instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
     ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
     that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
     these notices.
     ^L
       Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
     subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
     
       This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
     the Library into a program that is not a library.
     
       4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
     under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
     it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
     must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
     medium customarily used for software interchange.

       If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
     source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

       5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
     linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
     work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

       However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
     contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
     library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
     
       When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
     that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
     derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
     Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
     linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
     threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

       If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
     work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
     Library will still fall under Section 6.)

       Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
     Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
     ^L
       6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
     engineering for debugging such modifications.
     
       You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
     this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
     during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
     copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
     directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
     of these things:
     
         a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
         machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
         changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
         Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
         with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
         uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
         user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
         executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
         that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
         Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
         to use the modified definitions.)

         b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
         least three years, to give the same user the materials
         specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
         than the cost of performing this distribution.

         c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
         from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
         specified materials from the same place.
     
         d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
         materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
     
       For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
     the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
     distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
     which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
     the executable.
     
       It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
     use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
     distribute.
     ^L
       7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
     facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
     library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
     the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
     permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
     
         a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
         based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
         facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
         Sections above.
     
         b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
         that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
         where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
     
       8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
     the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
     rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
     or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
     
       9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Library or works based on it.

       10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
     Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
     ^L
       11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
     particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
     and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
     integrity of the free software distribution system which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
     to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
     impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
     be a consequence of the rest of this License.
     
       12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
     original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
     an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
     so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
     written in the body of this License.
     
       13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
     but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
     "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
     conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
     the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
     license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
     the Free Software Foundation.
     ^L
       14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
     write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
     copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
     Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
     decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
     of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.
     
                                 NO WARRANTY
     
       15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
     LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
     THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
     
       16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
     LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
     RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
     FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
     SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
     DAMAGES.
     
                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
          Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
     
       If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
     everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
     redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
     ordinary General Public License).
     
       To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
     safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
     "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
     
         <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     
         This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
         modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
         License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
         version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
         This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
         Library General Public License for more details.
     
         You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
         License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
         Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,
         MA 02111-1307, USA
     
     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
     
     You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
     school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
     necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
     
       Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
       library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random
     Hacker.
     
       <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
       Ty Coon, President of Vice
     
     That's all there is to it!

            (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 
            4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
            absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

     3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Application of License.

      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation 
      Section 2.2.  The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed 
      only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License 
      released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License 
      with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or 
      impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. 
      However, You may include an additional document offering the additional 
      rights described in Section 3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code.

      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable
      version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
      Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after 
      the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a
      subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made 
      available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the 
      Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
      Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

      3.3. Description of Modifications.

      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
      a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code
      and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
            (a) Third Party Claims.

            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third
            party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the 
            rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, 
            Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code 
            distribution titled "LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the 
            party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will 
            know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
            the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, 
            Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies 
            Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps 
            (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) 
            reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
            Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs.

            If Contributor's Modifications include an application
            programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent 
            licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, 
            Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

            (c)   Representations.

            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
            Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
            Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or 
            Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by 
            this License.

      3.5. Required Notices.

      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
      Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a
      particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include 
      such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user 
      would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more
      Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice 
      described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any 
      documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or
      ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and 
      to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations
      to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
      only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
      Contributor.

      You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
      agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a 
      result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and 
      if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the 
      Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a 
      description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of 
      Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in 
      an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You 
      describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may 
      distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights 
      under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from 
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this 
      License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt 
      to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from 
      the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the Executable 
      version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that 
      any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not 
      by the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to 
      indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability 
      incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any 
      such terms You offer.

      3.7. Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
      as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
      of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

      4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
      judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
      of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
      limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included 
      in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all 
      distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by 
      statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed 
      for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

     5. Application of this License.

      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

     6. Versions of the License.

      6.1. New Versions.

      Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish
      revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
      will be given a distinguishing version number.

      6.2. Effect of New Versions.

      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
      the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of
      that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to 
      Covered Code created under this License.

      6.3. Derivative Works.

      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you
      may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
      Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', "MPL",
      ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license
      (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)
      otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms 
      which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
      (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or 
      Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves 
      be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

     7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE 
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. 
      SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE 
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY 
      NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY 
      CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
      CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

     8. TERMINATION.

      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail
      to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
      any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
      file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:

      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly 
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
      upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if
      within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing
      to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past
      and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) 
      withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version 
      against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable 
      royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing 
      by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights 
      granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
      terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such
      Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any
      patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
      2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made,
      used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that 
      Participant.

      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against
      Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly
      or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
      litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
      Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in 
      determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or
      8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors
      and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
      hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

     9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER,
      ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
      OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
      OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
      IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
      PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
      APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
      THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

     10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined
      in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial computer
      software'' and ''commercial computer software documentation,'' as such 
      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 
      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), 
      all U.S.  Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those 
      rights set forth herein.

     11. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
      necessary to make it enforceable.

      This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to
      the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
      conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least 
      one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do 
      business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this
      License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of 
      the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara 
      County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, 
      including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees 
      and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on 
      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
      be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

     12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, 
      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such 
      responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or 
      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

     13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
      Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer 
      permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of 
      the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial 
      Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

	INDEPENDENT JPEG GROUPS JPEG SOFTWARE

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

     In plain English:

     1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
        please let us know!)
     2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay
        us.
     3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
        program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
        you've used the IJG code.

     In legalese:

     The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
     with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
     fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and
     you,
     its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
     
     This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
     All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
     
     Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
     software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
     these
     conditions:
     (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then
     this
     README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
     unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
     must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
     (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
     documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work
     of
     the Independent JPEG Group".
     (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
     full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
     NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
     
     These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
     code,
     not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
     acknowledge us.
     
     Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company
     name
     in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived
     from
     it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
     software".
     
     We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis
     of
     commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
     assumed by the product vendor.
     
     ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
     Deutsch,
     sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park,
     CA.
     ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but
     instead
     by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation;
     principally,
     that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
     ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as
     part
     of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more
     than
     the foregoing paragraphs do.
     
     The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
     It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
     distributable.
     The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
     ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
     by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
     
     It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
     patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
     legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
     support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
     (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
     Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support
     it.)
     So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
     code.
     
     The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
     To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
     been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
     "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
     resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
     GIF decoders.
     
     We are required to state that
         "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
         CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
         CompuServe Incorporated."

     This license has been certified as Open Source(tm).

     Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
     modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are
     met:
     
     1. Redistributions in source code must retain the above copyright
        notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer.
     
     2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright
        notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer in
        the documentation and/or other materials provided with the
        distribution.
      
     3. Digital Creations requests that attribution be given to Zope
        in any manner possible. Zope includes a "Powered by Zope"
        button that is installed by default. While it is not a license
        violation to remove this button, it is requested that the
        attribution remain. A significant investment has been put
        into Zope, and this effort will continue if the Zope community
        continues to grow. This is one way to assure that growth.
     
     4. All advertising materials and documentation mentioning
        features derived from or use of this software must display
        the following acknowledgement:
     
          "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
          for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
          (http://www.zope.org/)."
     
        In the event that the product being advertised includes an
        intact Zope distribution (with copyright and license included)
        then this clause is waived.
     
     5. Names associated with Zope or Digital Creations must not be used to
        endorse or promote products derived from this software without
        prior written permission from Digital Creations.
      
     6. Modified redistributions of any form whatsoever must retain
        the following acknowledgment:
     
           "This product includes software developed by Digital Creations
           for use in the Z Object Publishing Environment
           (http://www.zope.org/)."
      
         Intact (re-)distributions of any official Zope release do not
         require an external acknowledgement.
 
      7. Modifications are encouraged but must be packaged separately as
         patches to official Zope releases.  Distributions that do not
         clearly separate the patches from the original work must be clearly
         labeled as unofficial distributions.  Modifications which do not
         carry the name Zope may be packaged in any form, as long as they
         conform to all of the clauses above.

                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

     Introduction
     ============
     
       The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
       some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
       various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
       FreeType Project.
     
       This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
       which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
       affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
       documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
     
       This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
       (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
       and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
       alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
     
         o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
           interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
     
         o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
           full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

         o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
           it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
           somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
           FreeType code. (`credits')
     
       We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
       software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
       We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
       assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
     

       Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
       credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
       encourage you to use the following text:
     
        """  
         Portions of this software are copyright ? <year> The FreeType
         Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
        """
     
       Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
       actually use.


     Legal Terms
     ===========

     0. Definitions
     --------------
     
       Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
       and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
       distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
       Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
       beta or final release.
     
       `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
       `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
       code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
       This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
       engine'.
     
       This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
       FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
       documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
       original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
       If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
       this license, you must contact us to verify this.
     
       The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
       Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
       specified below.
     
     1. No Warranty
     --------------
     
       THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
       KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
       WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
       PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
       BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
       USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

     2. Redistribution
     -----------------
     
       This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
       irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
       display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
       sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
       forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
       authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
       herein, subject to the following conditions:
     
         o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
           (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
           the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
           documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
           original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
           files.
     
         o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
           states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
           FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
           encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
           documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
     
       These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
       the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
       our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
       to us.
     
     3. Advertising
     --------------
     
       Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
       the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
       purposes without specific prior written permission.
     
       We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
       following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
       or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
       `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
     
       As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
       accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
       material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
       authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
       Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
       Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
       of this license.
     
     4. Contacts
     -----------
     
       There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
     
         o freetype@nongnu.org
     
           Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
           future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
           If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
           haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
     
         o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

     Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to do the
     following: (i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI, to reproduce,

     undertaking any of the aforementioned actions. The patent license shall

     added, such addition of the Modification causes such combination to be
     covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii)
     shall not apply to any other combinations that include the Modification. No
     patent license is provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI
     Patents by Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original
     Code and Modifications not provided by SGI. 
     2.2.Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and any
     third party intellectual property claims, Recipient hereby grants SGI and
     any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license,
     under any Recipient Patents, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
     import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code and/or any Modifications
     provided by SGI.
     2.3.No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in
     Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of the
     algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any Modifications provided by
     SGI .
     3.Redistributions. 
     3.1.Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in Exhibit A,
     below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and all
     redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered Code in
     source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can include a
     text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this
     License must appear in related documentation or collateral where the
     Recipient?s rights relating to Covered Code are described. Any Additional
     Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original Code must also be
     retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code.
     3.2.Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the
     terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any
     of SGI?s rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source code
     and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a
     license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
     necessary in order to clarify Recipient?s role as licensor of
     Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient?s choosing, containing
     terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include
     this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be
     modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient
     elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient must make it
     absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License are
     offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this
     License is a limited license, and, regardless of the license form employed
     by Recipient in accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense
     only such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has
     actually been granted by SGI in this License.
     3.3.Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability
     incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms Recipient
     offers.
     4.Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such
     breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code that is
     properly granted shall survive any termination of this License, absent
     termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their
     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall
     survive.
     5.No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
     (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
     licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
     otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark
     or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right
     for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the
     Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title
     to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with
     SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this
     License are reserved. 
     6.Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws,
     regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered
     Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import control
     laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other
     countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
     regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered
     Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any
     intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or
     (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
     statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have
     been subject.
     7.Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that
     any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially
     infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient will
     promptly notify SGI of such claim.
     8.Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
     under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under
     the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the
     provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the
     terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
     9.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS AND

     WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
     LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF

     WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND

     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
     SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
     SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
     SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL

     11.Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
     License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon

     courts of the State of California), with venue lying exclusively in Santa
     Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs,
     including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and

     2.4  GLX Public License

     GLX PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 1.0 (2/11/99)) ("License")

     Subject to any third party claims, Silicon Graphics, Inc. ("SGI") hereby
     grants permission to Recipient (defined below), under Recipient's
     copyrights
     in the Original Software (defined below), to use, copy, modify, merge, pub-
     lish, distribute, sublicense and/or sell copies of Subject Software
     (defined
     below), and to permit persons to whom the Subject Software is furnished in
     accordance with this License to do the same, subject to all of the
     following
     terms and conditions, which Recipient accepts by engaging in any such use,
     copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing or
     selling:
     
     1. Definitions.

          (a) "Original Software" means source code of computer software code
          which is described in Exhibit A as Original Software.

          (b) "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
          stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
          Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
          files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
          the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous
          Modifications and (ii) any new file that contains any part of the
          Original Code or previous Modifications.

          (c) "Subject Software" means the Original Software or Modifications
          or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, or
          portions of any of the foregoing.

          (d) "Recipient" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
          rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
          For legal entities, "Recipient" includes any entity which controls,
          is controlled by, or is under common control with Recipient. For
          purposes of this definition, "control" of an entity means (a) the
          power, direct or indirect, to direct or manage such entity, or (b)
          ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares
          or beneficial ownership of such entity.

     2. Redistribution of Source Code Subject to These Terms. Redistributions of
     Subject Software in source code form must retain the notice set forth in
     Exhibit A, below, in every file. A copy of this License must be included in
     any documentation for such Subject Software where the recipients' rights
     relating to Subject Software are described. Recipient may distribute the
     source code version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
     choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
     (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
     license terms include this Section 2 and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13
     of this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
     terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the source code version
     under
     a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
     which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
     Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI
     as a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

     3. Redistribution in Executable Form. The notice set forth in Exhibit A
     must
     be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version of Subject
     Software, related documentation or collateral in which Recipient describes
     the user's rights relating to the Subject Software. Recipient may
     distribute
     the executable version of Subject Software under a license of Recipient's
     choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that
     (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, and (ii) the
     license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of
     this License, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
     terms of such license. If Recipient distributes the executable version
     under
     a different license Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any terms
     which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, not by SGI.
     Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI
     as a result of any such terms Recipient offers.

     4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
     terminate
     automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
     cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the
     Subject
     Software which is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
     License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions
     which,
     by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
     License shall survive.

     5. No Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
     trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark
     or service mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived 
     from the Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.

     6. No Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights with respect to
     the OpenGL API or to any software or hardware implementation thereof or to
     any other software whatsoever, nor shall any other rights or licenses not
     expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise
     with
     respect to the Subject Software. Title to and ownership of the Original
     Soft-
     ware at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Software not
     expressly granted under this License are reserved.
     
     7. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
     applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
     the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
     control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
     Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
     (directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
     secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
     other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
     express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
     deemed to have been distributed.

     8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any
     one
     or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, distribu-
     tion, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular
     functionality
     or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's
     intel-
     lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
     bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a
     description
     of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
     Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon
     gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
     include the URL for such web page in the Exhibit A notice required under
     Sec-
     tions 2 and 3, above, and in the text of any related documentation, license
     agreement or collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights
     relat-
     ing to the Subject Software. If Recipient obtains such knowledge after it
     makes Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
     shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
     news-
     groups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Subject
     Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

     9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
     BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
     CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON- INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
     PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY
     SER-
     VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS
     AUTHORIZED
     HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
     
     10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THE-
     ORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIA-
     BILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     FOR
     ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
     STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL
     OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
     OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
     APPLY
     TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE
     TO
     THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
     NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES,
     SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

     11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
     License.
     Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc.
     from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including
     the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
     modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Software or out
     of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

     12. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"
     consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in
     title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S.  Government End
     Users acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to
     the terms of this License.
     
     13. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
     concerning
     subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
     forceable, such provision shall be reformed so as to achieve as nearly as
     possible the same economic effect as the original provision and the
     remainder
     of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be governed by
     and
     construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
     California as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed
     entirely
     within California between California residents. Any litigation relating to
     this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal
     Courts of the Northern District of California (or, absent subject matter
     jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of California), with
     venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing
     party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
     reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United
     Nations
     Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
     excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a con-
     tract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
     License.

     b. "Modifications" means any addition to or deletion from the sub-
     stance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous
     Modifications. When Subject Software is released as a series of
     files, a Modification means (i) any addition to or deletion from
     the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous

     ware files that do not contain any Original Software or any previ-
     ous Modification shall not be deemed a Modification, even if such
     software files are aggregated as part of a product, or in any
     medium of storage, with any file that does contain Original Soft-
     ware or any previous Modification.

     2. License Terms. All distribution of the Subject Software must be made
     sub-
     ject to the terms of this License. A copy of this License and the Required
     Notice must be included in any documentation for Subject Software where
     Recipient's rights relating to Subject Software and/or any Accompanying
     Tech-
     nology are described. Distributions of Subject Software in source code form
     must also include the Required Notice in every file distributed. In
     addition,
     a ReadMe file entitled "Important Legal Notice" must be distributed with
     each
     distribution of one or more files that incorporate Subject Software. That
     file must be included with distributions made in both source code and exe-
     cutable form. A copy of the License and the Required Notice must be
     included
     in that file.  Recipient may distribute Accompanying Technology under a
     license of Recipient's choice, which may contain terms different from this
     License, provided that (i) Recipient is in compliance with the terms of
     this
     License, (ii) such other license terms do not modify or supersede the terms
     of this License as applicable to the Subject Software, (iii) Recipient
     hereby
     indemnifies SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of the
     distri-
     bution of Accompanying Technology or the use of other license terms.

     3. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
     terminate
     automatically if Recipient fails to comply with terms herein and fails to
     cure such breach within 30 days of the breach. Any sublicense to the
     Subject
     Software that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
     License absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions
     which,
     by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
     License shall survive.
     
     4. Trademark Rights. This License does not grant any rights to use any
     trade
     name, trademark or service mark whatsoever. No trade name, trademark or
     ser-
     vice mark of SGI may be used to endorse or promote products derived from or
     incorporating any Subject Software without prior written permission of SGI.
     
     5. No Other Rights. No rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder
     shall arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise. Title to and ownership

     Original Software not expressly granted under this License are reserved.
     
     6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. Recipient shall comply with all
     applicable laws and regulations in connection with use and distribution of
     the Subject Software, including but not limited to, all export and import
     control laws and regulations of the U.S. government and other countries.
     Recipient may not distribute Subject Software that (i) in any way infringes
     (directly or contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade
     secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights of any kind) of any
     other person or entity, or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty,
     express, implied or statutory, which under any applicable law it might be
     deemed to have been distributed.

     7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any 
     one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use, 
     distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular
     functionality
     or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the third party's
     intel-
     lectual property rights, Recipient must place in a well-identified web page
     bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each such claim and a
     description
     of the party making each such claim in sufficient detail that a user of the
     Subject Software will know whom to contact regarding the claim. Also, upon
     gaining such knowledge of any such claim, Recipient must conspicuously
     include the URL for such web page in the Required Notice, and in the text
     of any related documentation, license agreement or collateral in which
     Recipient
     describes end user's rights relating to the Subject Software. If Recipient
     obtains such knowledge after it makes Subject Software available to any
     other
     person or entity, Recipient shall take other steps (such as notifying
     appro-
     priate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to provide such
     knowledge to those who received the Subject Software.

     8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
     BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
     WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MER-
     CHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. SGI ASSUMES NO
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD ANY SOFTWARE
     PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR ANY
     SER-
     VICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS
     AUTHORIZED
     HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

     9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL
     THEORY,
     WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
     LIABILITY),
     CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
     CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT
     OR
     OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE
     OR
     THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
     NOT
     ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
     LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT TO THE EXTENT SO DISALLOWED.
     
     10. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
     License.
     Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold SGI and its successors and
     assigns
     harmless from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses
     (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of
     (Recipi-
     ent's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Subject Soft-
     ware or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

     11. U.S. Government End Users. The Subject Software is a "commercial item"

     Users
     acquire only the rights set forth in this License and are subject to the
     terms of this License.
     
     12. Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
     concerning
     subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unen-
     forceable by any judicial or administrative authority having proper
     jurisdic-
     tion with respect thereto, such provision shall be reformed so as to
     achieve
     as nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision
     and
     the remainder of this License will remain in effect. This License shall be
     governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States
     and the State of California as applied to agreements entered into and to be
     performed entirely within California between California residents. Any
     liti-
     gation relating to this License shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdic-
     tion of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California (or,
     absent
     subject matter jurisdiction in such courts, the courts of the State of
     Cali-
     fornia), with venue lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California,
     with

         intellectual property protections inherent in the Original Code, SGI
         hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
         license, to do the following: (i) under copyrights Licensable by SGI,
         to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works from, and, to the
         extent applicable, display and perform the Original Code and/or any
         Modifications provided by SGI alone and/or as part of a Larger Work;
         and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to make, have made, use, sell,
         offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
         and/or any Modifications provided by SGI. Recipient accepts the terms
         and conditions of this License by undertaking any of the aforementioned
        actions. The patent license shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the
         time any related Modification is added, such addition of the
         Modification causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
         Patents. The patent license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any
         other combinations that include the Modification.  No patent license is
        provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by
         Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code and
         Modifications not provided by SGI.

         offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer the Original Code
         and/or any Modifications provided by SGI.
     
         2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in
         Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in Hardware of
        the algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any Modifications
         provided by SGI .

     3. Redistributions.

         3.1. Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in
         Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any and
        all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the Covered
         Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file that can
        include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a
         copy of this License must appear in related documentation or collateral
        where the Recipient's rights relating to Covered Code are described.
         Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original
        Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions
         of Covered Code.
     
         3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with
        the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation
         of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the
         source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this
        License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such
         changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as
         licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's
         choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that
         the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12,
         and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
         terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other
         than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of
         its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient
         alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited
         license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in
         accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such
         rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually
         been granted by SGI in this License.

         3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
         liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license
         terms Recipient offers.

     4. Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
     terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to
     cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code
     that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License,
     absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by
     their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License,
     shall survive.
     
     5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to:
     (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or
     licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or
     otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark
     or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right
     for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the
     Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title
     to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with
     SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this
     License are reserved.
     
     6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide
     laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of
     Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import
     control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and
     other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws,
     regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered
     Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any
     intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or
     (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or
     statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have
     been subject.

     7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
     that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
     partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
     Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
     
     8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number.
     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
     License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it
     under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under
     the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the
     provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the
     terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

     9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL EXPRESS
     AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
     SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
     NON-INFRINGEMENT. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
     THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, SGI
     ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
     DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
     COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT SUBJECT TO THIS DISCLAIMER.

     10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NOR LEGAL THEORY,
     WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
     LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
     ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
     WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
     ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
     SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
     SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
     SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
     OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
     RECIPIENT.
     
     11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising,
     directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
     License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon
     Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
     expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out
     of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the
     Covered Code or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.
     
     12. U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item"
     consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are defined in

     License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
     the United States and the State of California as applied to agreements
     entered into and to be performed entirely within California between
     California residents. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
     subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California (or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in such
     courts, the courts of the State of California), with venue lying
     exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party
     responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and
     reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United

        VI IMPROVED

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

     VIM LICENSE

     I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim 
         except
         that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
         unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must
         include this license text.  You are also allowed to include 
         executables
         that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
         examples and Vim scripts.
     
     II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,
         including executables and/or source code, when the following four
         conditions are met:
         1) This license text must be included unmodified.
         2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five 
            ways:
            a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in
               the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks 
               you
               (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
               must make your changes, including source code, available to the
               maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
               include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
               maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
               will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no 
               negotiation
               then this license, or a later version, also applies to your 
               changes.
               The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this
               changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
               vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is 
               completely
               impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
               your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he 
               has
               received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
            b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as
               mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
               unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes 
               the
               text under a) applies to those changes.
            c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy 
               of
               the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form 
               of a
               context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code 
               you
               add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
               making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
            d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned
               under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
               changes if the following three conditions are met:
               - The license that applies to the changes permits you to 
                 distribute
                 the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, 
                 and
                 permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the 
                 official
                 version of Vim without fee or restriction.
               - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
                 distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the 
                 maintainer
                 or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
                 any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them
                 available to him.
               - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  
                 This
                 contact information must remain valid for at least three years
                 after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as 
                 long
                 as possible.
            e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
               you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 
               or
               any later version.
         3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version"
            command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified
            Vim
            is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned
            under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this 
            does
            not conflict with the license used for the changes.
         4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
            removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
            corrections.
     
     III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
          the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the
          maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this 
          is
          by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.
          If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) 
          e-mailing a
          context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
          <maintainer@vim.org>
     
     IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of 
          the Vim
          sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
          license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they 
          came
          with, at your option.

	GNU LIBTOOL DLOPEN WRAPPER  

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble
    
      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
    your programs, too.
    
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
    
      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
    
      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
    rights.
    
      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
    distribute and/or modify the software.
    
      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
    authors' reputations.
    
      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
    
      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.
    ^L
                        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
    
      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
    under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
    refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
    the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
    
    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
    
      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
    along with the Program.
    
    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
    
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    
        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    
        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of this License.
    
        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
    ^L
    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
    
    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
    collective works based on the Program.
    
    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
    the scope of this License.
    
      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
    
        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,
    
        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
        customarily used for software interchange; or,
    
        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
        received the program in object code or executable form with such
        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
    
    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
    special exception, the source code distributed need not include
    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.
    
    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
    ^L
      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
    parties remain in full compliance.
    
      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
    the Program or works based on it.
    
      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
    this License.
    
      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
    
    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.
    
    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
    impose that choice.
    
    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
    be a consequence of the rest of this License.
    ^L
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
    
      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
    address new problems or concerns.
    
    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
    later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
    Software
    Foundation.
    
      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
    
                                NO WARRANTY
    
      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    
                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    ^L
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
    
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
    
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    
        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
       Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    
        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
    
        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU General Public License for more details.
    
        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
        along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
            Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307
    USA
    
    
    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
    
    If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
    when it starts in an interactive mode:
    
        Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
        Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show
    w'.
        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
    
    The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
    parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
    
    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
    school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
    
      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
    
      <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
      Ty Coon, President of Vice
    
    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
    library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
    Public License instead of this License.

     Use of this software is governed by the terms of the following
     license:

     Operating System Distributor License for Java version 1.1

     SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. ("SUN") IS WILLING TO LICENSE THE JAVA PLATFORM
     STANDARD EDITION DEVELOPER KIT ("JDK" - THE "SOFTWARE") TO YOU ONLY
     UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS
     LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE "AGREEMENT"). PLEASE READ THE AGREEMENT
     CAREFULLY. BY INSTALLING, USING, OR DISTRIBUTING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU
     ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT.

     1.  DEFINITIONS. "Software" means the code identified above in binary
         form, any other machine readable materials including, but not
         limited to, libraries, source files, header files, and data files),
         any updates or error corrections provided by Sun, and any user
         manuals, programming guides and other documentation provided to you
         by Sun under this Agreement, and any subsequent versions that Sun
         makes available to you hereunder.  "Operating System" means any
         version of the Linux or OpenSolaris operating systems that manages
         the hardware resources of a general purpose desktop or server
         computer and shares these resources with various software programs
         that run on top of it. "Programs" means Java technology applets and
         applications intended to run on the Java Platform Standard Edition
         (Java SE platform) platform on Java-enabled general purpose desktop
         computers and servers.
     
     2.  License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
         Agreement, as well as the restrictions and exceptions set forth in
         the Software README file, Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
         non-transferable, royalty-free limited license to reproduce and use
         the Software internally, complete and unmodified, for the sole
         purposes of running Programs and designing, developing and testing
         Programs.  Sun also grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
         royalty-free limited license to reproduce and distribute the
         Software, directly or indirectly through your licensees,
         distributors, resellers, or OEMs, electronically or in physical
         form or pre-installed with your Operating System on a general
         purpose desktop computer or server, provided that: (a) the Software
         and any proprietary legends or notices are complete and unmodified;
         (b) the Software is distributed with your Operating System, and
         such distribution is solely for the purposes of running Programs
         under the control of your Operating System and designing,
         developing and testing Programs to be run under the control of your
         Operating System; (c) you do not combine, configure or distribute
         the Software to run in conjunction with any additional software
         that implements the same or similar functionality or APIs as the
         Software; (d) you do not remove or modify any included license
         agreement or impede or prevent it from displaying and requiring
         acceptance; (e) you only distribute the Software subject to this
         license agreement; and (f) you agree to defend and indemnify Sun
         and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities,
         settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees)
         incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any
         third party that arises or results from (i) the use or distribution
         of your Operating System, or any part thereof, in any manner, or
         (ii) your use or distribution of the Software in violation of the
         terms of this Agreement or applicable law.  You shall not be
         obligated under Section 2(f)(i) if such claim would not have
         occurred but for a modification made to your Operating System by
         someone not under your direction or control, and you were in
         compliance with all other terms of this Agreement.  If the Software
         README file permits certain files to be replaced or omitted from
         your distribution, then any such replacement(s) or omission(s)
         shall not be considered a breach of Section 2(a).
     
     3.  RESTRICTIONS.  Software is copyrighted and title to Software and
         all associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun
         and/or its licensors.  Unless enforcement is prohibited by
         applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer
         Software.  You may not create, modify, or change the behavior of,
         or authorize your licensees, distributors, resellers, OEMs, or end
         users (collectively, "Licensees") to create, modify, or change the
         behavior of, classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in any
         way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention as
         specified by Sun in any naming convention designation. You
         acknowledge that Licensed Software is not designed or intended for
         use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any
         nuclear facility. Sun Microsystems, Inc. disclaims any express or
         implied warranty of fitness for such uses.
     
     4.  COMPATIBILITY.  If you exercise the license in Section 2, and Sun
         or a licensee of the Software (under section 4(b)) notifies you
         that there are compatibility issues (as determined by the
         applicable Technology Compatibility Kit) caused by the interaction
         of the Software with your Operating System, then within ninety
         (90) days you must either: (a) modify the Operating System in a
         way that resolves the compatibility issue (as determined by Sun)
         and make a patch or replacement version available to your
         Licensees who have already received the version of your Operating
         System that was the subject of the compatibility issue ("Your
         Incompatible Operating System"); or (b) cease distributing the
         Software and make commercially reasonable attempts to forward the
         notification to your Licensees who have already received Your
         Incompatible Operating System.
     
     5.  Trademarks and Logos. No right, title or interest in or to any
         trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its
         licensors is granted under this Agreement. You acknowledge and
         agree that, as between you and Sun, Sun owns the SUN and JAVA
         trademarks and all SUN and JAVA-related trademarks, service marks,
         logos and other brand designations ("Sun Marks"), and you agree to
         comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage Requirements
         currently located at http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. Any
         use you make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit.
     
     6.  LIMITED WARRANTY.  If you received the Software directly from Sun
         or its authorized resellers, Sun warrants to you that for a period
         of ninety (90) days from delivery to you, the media on which
         Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in
         materials and workmanship under normal use.  Except for the
         foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy
         and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be
         replacement of the Software media.  This limited warranty gives
         you specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from
         state to state.
     
     7.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL
         EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES,
         INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO
         THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.
     
     8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
         LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
         PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
         AGREEMENT (INCLUDING LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, DATA, OR OTHER ECONOMIC
         ADVANTAGE), NO MATTER WHAT THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF SUN HAS
         BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
         Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
         negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for the
         Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will
         apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential
         purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or
         consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
         applicable to you.
     
     9.  THIRD PARTY CODE. Additional copyright notices and license terms
         applicable to portions of the Software are set forth in the
         THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file. In addition to any terms and
         conditions of any third party opensource/freeware license
         identified in the THIRDPARTYLICENSEREADME.txt file, the disclaimer
         of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in paragraphs 7
         and 8 of this Agreement shall apply to all Software in this
         distribution.
     
     10. Termination.  This Agreement is effective until it is
         terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by
         ceasing distribution of the Software. This Agreement will
         terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to
         comply with any material provision herein.  Either party may
         terminate this Agreement immediately should any Software become,
         or in either party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a
         claim of infringement of any intellectual property right.  Upon
         termination, you must destroy all copies and cease copying and
         distribution of the Software. All of your obligations and any
         applicable limitations on your rights and remedies under this
         Agreement shall survive termination.
     
     11. SOURCE CODE.  Software may contain source code that, unless
         expressly licensed for other purposes, is provided solely for
         reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
         Source code may not be redistributed unless expressly provided for
         in this Agreement.
     
     12. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered
         under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may
         be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.
         You acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain such
         licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after
         delivery to you.
     
     13. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If Software is being acquired
         by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government
         prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
         Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation
         will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance
         with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense
         (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD
         acquisitions).
     
     14. MISCELLANEOUS.  Any action related to this Agreement will be
         governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  No
         choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. If any
         provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
         Agreement will remain in effect upon the parties' agreement to
         revised terms that most nearly accomplish the same effect. This
         Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to
         its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
         oral or written communications, proposals, representations and
         warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms
         of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication
         between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term
         of this Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be
         binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
         representative of each party.

     licenses:

     Copyright 2005 by NVIDIA Corporation.  All rights reserved.
     Use is subject to license terms.

     License For Customer Use of NVIDIA Software
     
     IMPORTANT NOTICE -- READ CAREFULLY: This License For Customer Use of
     NVIDIA Software ("LICENSE") is the agreement which governs use of the
     software of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries ("NVIDIA")
     downloadable herefrom, including computer software and associated
     printed materials ("SOFTWARE"). By downloading, installing, copying, or
     otherwise using the SOFTWARE, you agree to be bound by the terms of this
     LICENSE. If you do not agree to the terms of this LICENSE, do not
     download the SOFTWARE.
     
     RECITALS
     
     Use of NVIDIA's products requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, the
     hardware on a graphics controller board, and a personal computer. The
     SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright
     treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The
     SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for use, strictly in
     accordance with this document. The hardware is protected by various
     patents, and is sold, but this LICENSE does not cover that sale, since
     it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE. This
     LICENSE sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE LICENSE only.
     
     1. DEFINITIONS
     
     1.1 Customer. Customer means the entity or individual that downloads the
     SOFTWARE.
     
     2. GRANT OF LICENSE
     
     2.1 Rights and Limitations of Grant. NVIDIA hereby grants Customer the
     following non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the SOFTWARE,
     with the following limitations:
     
     2.1.1 Rights. Customer may install and use one copy of the SOFTWARE on a
     single computer, and except for making one back-up copy of the Software,
     may not otherwise copy the SOFTWARE. This LICENSE of SOFTWARE may not be
     shared or used concurrently on different computers.
     
     2.1.2 Linux/FreeBSD/OpenSolaris Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing
     terms of Section 2.1.1, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the
     Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived
     from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and
     redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified
     in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files).
     
     2.1.3 Limitations.
     
     No Reverse Engineering. Customer may not reverse engineer, decompile, or
     disassemble the SOFTWARE, nor attempt in any other manner to obtain the
     source code.
     
     No Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single
     product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than
     one computer, nor otherwise used separately from the other parts.
     
     No Rental. Customer may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE to someone else.
     
     3. TERMINATION
     
     This LICENSE will automatically terminate if Customer fails to comply
     with any of the terms and conditions hereof. In such event, Customer
     must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE and all of its component parts.
     
     Defensive Suspension.  If Customer commences or participates in any
     legal proceeding against NVIDIA, then NVIDIA may, in its sole
     discretion, suspend or terminate all license grants and any other rights
     provided under this LICENSE during the pendency of such legal proceedings.
     
      
     
     4. COPYRIGHT
     
     All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE (including but not
     limited to all images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music,
     text, and other information incorporated into the SOFTWARE), the
     accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE, are
     owned by NVIDIA, or its suppliers. The SOFTWARE is protected by
     copyright laws and international treaty provisions. Accordingly,
     Customer is required to treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted
     material, except as otherwise allowed pursuant to this LICENSE and that
     it may make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archive purposes.
     
     5. APPLICABLE LAW
     
     This LICENSE shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be
     construed pursuant to, the laws of the State of California.  The United
     Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
     specifically disclaimed.
     
     6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION ON LIABILITY
     
     6.1 No Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
     THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND NVIDIA AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM

     PURPOSE.

     PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NVIDIA OR ITS SUPPLIERS

     OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
     USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.
     
     7. MISCELLANEOUS
     
     If any provision of this LICENSE is inconsistent with, or cannot be
     fully enforced under, the law, such provision will be construed as
     limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully
     enforceable under the law. This LICENSE is the final, complete and
     exclusive agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter
     hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings and
     agreements relating to such subject matter, whether oral or written.
     This LICENSE may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized
