NAME

     ai_manifest - automated installation manifest file format


DESCRIPTION

     The automated installer (AI) provides a customizable,
     hands-free installation mechanism for Oracle Solaris and
     uses an XML-based file format as the description of the
     installation parameters.  This file is called an AI
     manifest.  The installation can be customized in various
     ways such as disk layout and the software to be installed
     on the system.  The sections in the AI manifest are the
     following:

        - Automated Install settings - settings used during the
          installation.

        - Disk Layouts - specifies the disk layout for the
          installation.

        - Software Sections - specifies the software packages to
          be installed and possibly uninstalled.

        - Boot Configuration - specifies how the GRUB boot menu
          will be set up.  (x86 only)

        - Other Configuration - specifies other configuration
          components to be installed onto the system.

     These sections are described in more detail below.

     When customizing an AI manifest, it is recommended that a
     copy of a template or default manifest from an install
     service's image be used with that install service.  For
     example, if an install service's image is located at
     <imagepath>, the following files are available:

        <imagepath>/auto_install/manifest/default.xml

           - A copy of the default AI manifest used for this
             install service when it was created.

        <imagepath>/auto_install/manifest/ai_manifest.xml

           - A commented, sample AI manifest with example
             usages of customizing the AI manifest.

     For more information about install services and their
     images, and how AI manifests are managed with install
     services, see installadm(1M).
     
     The automated installer is also used for installing native
     zones via the 'zoneadm install' command.  It is possible to
     pass an AI manifest file to this command to customize how
     a zone gets installed, but not all specifications in the
     manifest are applicable in this use-case.  These
     specifications are noted in the sections below.

     Complimentary to the AI manifest is the System Configuration
     (SC) profile.  An SC profile is an smf(5) profile, and is
     used to specify the system configuration desired for the
     installed system such as hostname, networking, root and
     initial user account settings.  See installadm(1M) for how
     SC profiles are managed with install services.  For more
     information on the SC profile file format, see profiles in
     smf(5).


AUTOMATED INSTALL SETTINGS

     The following describe the set of attributes of the
     <ai_instance> element.

        - name

          The name of this manifest instance.

        - http_proxy

          This defines a HTTP Proxy to be used for accessing
          remote files (e.g. the IPS repository) during the
          installation.  Its value is a HTTP URI, for example:

             http://myproxy.mycompany.com:8080/

          This attribute is not applicable when installing a
          zone and is ignored if provided.

        - auto_reboot

          This defaults to a value of "false", which will cause
          the install to wait for manual intervention to reboot.

          A value of "true" means that on a successful
          installation the machine will reboot into the installed
          boot environment.

          This attribute is not applicable when installing a
          zone and is ignored if provided.

     For example:

         <auto_install>
             <ai_instance name='default' auto_reboot='true'
                 http_proxy='http://myproxy.mycompany.com:8080/'>
                 ...
             </ai_instance>
         </auto_install>


DISK LAYOUTS

     The Automated Installer allows for a diverse specification
     of the targets varying from total automatic selection of the
     install target to very fine-grained/specific control of the
     final layout.

     For Oracle Solaris, the preferred default layout is defined
     to be the following:

        - Using the whole of one disk (usually the boot disk or
          first disk)
        - For X86, allocating a FDISK partition that consumes the
          full disk contents
        - For X86 and SPARC, defining a single slice 0, that will
          be the full size of the disk (or FDISK partition in the
          case of X86)
        - A single root pool that uses the complete slice 0.
        - Creation of a swap zvol, and a dump zvol, in the
          root pool, space permitting.
    
     If the <target> element is totally omitted (and thus any
     sub-elements) from the AI XML manifest, then the above is
     what will be generated.

     It is possible to be specific about any element of the
     <target> element by specifying the disks and/or the logical
     (zpools) layout using the relevant XML elements.  For zone
     installations, disk specifications are not applicable and
     will be ignored.

     The general structure is:

         <target>
             <!-- zero or more disk elements -->
             <disk ...>
                ...
             </disk>
             <logical...>
                 <!-- zero or more zpools -->
                 <zpool ...>
                 </zpool>
             </logical>
         </target>

     When specifying the layout, in some cases it may be possible
     to specify a size element and take the format:.

         <size val="SIZE" start_sector="START_SECTOR"/>

     The start_sector attribute may be omitted to allow the
     installer to search for the first location that is big
     enough to contain the specified SIZE. The START_SECTOR value
     is a numeric value that specifies the desired start sector
     for the new partition or slice.

     The values for SIZE are numeric with a suffix. Possible
     suffixes are:

        - s or sec: Sectors
        - b: Bytes
        - k or kb: Kilobytes (2^10)
        - m or mb: Megabytes (2^20)
        - g or gb: Gigabytes (2^30)
        - t or tb: Terabytes (2^40)
        - p or pb: Petabytes (2^50)
        - e or eb: Exabytes (2^60)
        - z or zb: Zettabytes (2^70)

     More detail of what is possible with <disk> and <logical>
     elements are as follows:

        - <disk> specification

           - Disk Selection

             Disks may be selected using various names and/or
             property values.
        
             Specifying a disk name for the device takes
             precedence since it is very specific, and this can
             be specified as one of:

                - ctd: Controller Target Disk Name

                  This is commonly what is seen when running
                  the format(1M) command, e.g.:

                      <disk_name name="c0t0d0" name_type="ctd"/>
        
                - volid: Volume Identifier

                  This is the volume identifier as can be set by
                  the format(1M) command.

                      <disk_name name="MY_BOOT_DISK" name_type="volid"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                - devpath: Device Path

                  This is the device path relative to the
                  /devices directory, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                      <disk_name
                          name="/devices/pci@0,0/pci10de,375@f/pci108e,286@0/disk@0,0"
                          name_type="devpath"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
               - devid: Device Identifier

                 This is a device identifier as can be found in
                 the devid in the prtconf command output, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                     <disk_name 
                         name="id1,sd@TSun_____STK_RAID_INT____F0F0F0"
                         name_type="devid"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
               - receptacle: Receptacle identifier 
        
                 This is the receptacle value from a CRO
                 (Chassis, Receptacle, Occupant) configuration
                 (see the croinfo(1M) manpage), e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                     <disk_name name="SYS/1" name_type="receptacle"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             While the <disk_name> is very specific, the
             <disk_prop> specification will attempt to do a
             best-match based on the criteria provided.  The
             types of criteria that are possible are:

                - dev_type: Device type

                - dev_vendor: Device Vendor

                  This is the vendor as would be seen using the
                  'inquiry' command in format(1M), e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                      <disk_prop dev_vendor="Sun"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                - dev_chassis: Device Chassis

                  This is the device chassis as seen in the
                  output of the croinfo(1M) command, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                      <disk_prop dev_chassis="SYS"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                - dev_size: Device Size

                  This specifies a minimum size for the disk to
                  be selected, and is specified using a number
                  with a size unit, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                      <disk_prop dev_size="100gb"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             The <disk_prop> element allows the specification of
             one or more of the attributes at the same time to
             allow further restriction of the match, e.g:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <disk_prop dev_vendor="HITACHI" dev_size="100gb"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             which would limit the selection of a disk to a 100Gb
             Hitachi drive.
        
             It is also possible to select the system's boot-disk
             by specifying a <disk_keyword> element, for example:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <disk_keyword key="boot_disk"/>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             It is possible to select an iSCSI disk by specifying
             the <iscsi> element, which has the following
             attributes:

                - target_name

                  The name refers to the iSCSI Qualified Name
                  (IQN) or the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)
                  of the iSCSI target, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                      iqn.1986-03.com.sun:02:a4a694bc-6de2-ee50-8979-e25ba29acb86
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                - source

                  This refers to the source of the iSCSI
                  configuration data. The only supported values
                  for source at present are:
          
                     manifest
            
                     Referring to the AI manifest itself - this
                     is the default if no value is specified for
                     this attribute.
          
                     dhcp
          
                     Referring to the use of DHCP where the iSCSI
                     information is then sourced by it being
                     specified in the DHCP Rootpath parameter.
                     In this case, no other attributes should be
                     specified.

                - target_lun

                  Where it is possible that a iSCSI target has
                  several LUNs, it is possible to isolate which
                  of these correspond to the disk to use by
                  specifying a number for 'target_lun'. 

                  If there is more than one LUN provided by the
                  iSCSI target, then it is necessary to specify a
                  value for 'target_lun'. The values are indexed
                  from 0, so the first LUN would be LUN 0.

                  If there is only one LUN provided, then it is
                  safe to omit this value.

                - target_port

                  If not specified, the default target_port of
                  3260 (the iSCSI standard port) is used. This
                  allows for an alternative port number to be
                  used.

             iSCSI does not have an action attribute. AI uses
             iSCSI devices but we do not operate directly on
             them.

             If the "target_name" attribute is not provided, we
             will use iscsiadm in sendtargets mode, otherwise we
             will set up static discovery.

             The IP address of the server is specified using the
             <ip> sub-element with the IP address in the text
             part of the element:

                 <ip>ADDRESS</ip>

             Given this information the device will be made
             available for installation.

           - Disk Layout

             The <disk> element has a couple of possible
             attributes:

              - whole_disk

                This defaults to "false" and in this scenario it 
                is necessary to always provide some definition of
                the partitions and/or slices.

                If the whole_disk flag is set to "false" for the
                <disk> element, then any existing partitions or
                slices will be retained unless deletion is
                specified. 
          
                Otherwise, if it is set to "true" then existing
                partitions or slices will be wiped unless
                specifically preserved in the layout.

              - in_zpool and in_vdev

                If specified, this partition will be used as part
                of the zpool and in the vdev specified.

             The simplest way to layout a disk is to use the
             whole disk for installation by setting the
             whole_disk attribute to "true".
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <disk whole_disk="true">
                     <disk_name name="c0t0d0" name_type="ctd"/>
                 </disk>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             For more complex layouts it is possible to specify
             partitions (on X86 only) and/or slices. 

             Sizes can be specified as sub-elements of
             <partition> or <slice> elements. If omitted then the
             installer will search for a suitable gap on the disk
             that is big enough to hold the installation, and
             will use that full gap.

             Partitions

                Partitions can only be specified when installing
                to an X86 based client - specifying them for a
                SPARC client will fail. Partitions consist of
                several attributes:

                - name:

                  This is the FDISK partition number, with number
                  1 to 4, being primary partitions. If one of the
                  primary partitions is an extended partition,
                  then it is possible to use the numbers 5 to 32
                  to refer to logical partitions. 
              
                  In most cases this is a required attribute. The
                  only case where it is not is if the action
                  specified is "use_existing_solaris2".

               - action

                 The action for a partition can be one of the
                 following values:

                    create

                    This is the default action for a partition,
                    and specifies that a partition is to be
                    created. If there is an existing partition
                    with the same name then that partition will
                    be deleted first.

                    delete

                    This specifies that the named partition is to
                    be deleted.  Should this partition not exist
                    it will be skipped over and a warning output.

                    preserve

                    This specifies that the named partition is to
                    be untouched, and is commonly used where
                    there is another operating system installed
                    elsewhere on the same disk.

                    use_existing_solaris2

                    This specifies to use an existing Solaris2
                    partition.  In this case it possible, and
                    preferred, that the name be omitted so that
                    the installer may search for the Solaris2
                    partition itself.

                - part_type

                  This is used to specify a FDISK partition type,
                  and defaults to 191 which is the partition type
                  for a Solaris2 partition. See the fdisk(1M)
                  command for more information on possible
                  partition types.

                - in_zpool and in_vdev

                  If specified, then this states that this
                  partition will be used as part of the zpool and
                  in the vdev specified.

                Partitions may also have <size> sub-element to
                specify the size of the partition.  See above for
                details of how the <size> element is specified.

                To create a 10gb Solaris2 partition, using
                default values, you could write it as simply as:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                    <partition name="1">
                        <size val="10gb"/>
                    </partition>
.fi
.in -9

                It is not necessary to specify the size with an
                action of "preserve", "delete" or
                "use_existing_solaris2".

             Slices

                For X86, when specifying slices, they must be
                contained within a partition definition. 

                Slice elements have several attributes that may
                be specified:

                - name:

                  This is the slice number with the numbers
                  ranging from 0 to 7

                - action

                  The action for a slice can be one of the
                  following values:

                     create

                     This is the default action for a slice, and
                     specifies that a slice is to be created. If
                     there is an existing slice with the same
                     name then that slice will be deleted first.

                     delete

                     This specifies that the named slice is to be
                     deleted. If this slice does not exist, it
                     will be skipped over and a warning will be
                     given.

                     preserve

                     This specifies that the named slice is to be
                     untouched, and is commonly used where there
                     is existing data from a previous
                     installation already present.

                - is_swap

                  This attribute defaults to "false" and is used
                  to specify that the slice being created is to
                  be used as a swap device. By default a swap
                  zvol will be created in the root pool, but in
                  some instances it may be preferable to use a
                  swap slice.  If this attribute is set to
                  "true", the in_zpool and in_vdev should not be
                  used.

                - force

                  This flag defaults to "false". Setting it to
                  "true" tells the installer to ignore the fact
                  that an existing slice may be already be in use
                  for something else (e.g. is used in an existing
                  zpool) and to continue to perform the specified
                  action on it.

                - in_zpool and in_vdev

                  If specified, then this states that this slice
                  will be used as part of the zpool and in the
                  vdev specified.

                  If a slice has these values then <disk> (and
                  possibly <partition>) elements should not have
                  them specified.

                Slices may also have <size> sub-element to
                specify the size of the slice.  See above for
                details of how the <size> element is specified.

                An example of creating a 20gb slice, using
                default values, and a 4gb swap slice is:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                    <slice name="0">
                        <size val="20gb"/>
                    </slice>
                    <slice name="1" is_swap="true">
                        <size val="4gb"/>
                    </slice>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                On X86, with a containing partition, this would
                be written as:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                    <partition name="1">
                        <slice name="0">
                            <size val="20gb"/>
                        </slice>
                        <slice name="1" is_swap="true">
                            <size val="4gb"/>
                        </slice>
                    </partition>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        - <logical> specification
        
           The logical section of the target specification
           defines the layout of the logical devices like the
           automatic addition of a swap or dump device and any
           number of zpools.

           The <logical> element has two attributes:

              - noswap

                This defaults to "false", meaning that if space
                allows, a swap zvol will automatically be created
                in the root zpool. If set to "true" then no swap
                zvol will automatically be created.

              - nodump

                This defaults to "false", meaning that if space
                allows, a dump zvol will automatically be created
                in the root zpool. If set to "true" then no dump
                zvol will automatically be created.

           It is possible to add several zpool definitions using
           the <zpool> sub-element. Only one of these may be
           defined as being the root pool, multiple root pools
           will fail.

           - <zpool> specification

             The <zpool> element has several attributes that
             can be specified:

                - name

                  The zpool created will use this name and is
                  limited to a name that can be passed to the
                  zpool create command. 

                  The name here can be used in other elements
                  "in_zpool" attribute.

                - action

                  The action attribute can have several possible
                  values:

                  create

                     This specifies that the zpool is to be
                     created.

                  delete

                     This specifies that the zpool is to be
                     deleted.

                  preserve

                     This specifies that the zpool is to be
                     preserved, unmodified.  This only is
                     possible to use for a non-root pool.

                  use_existing

                     This specifies that the root zpool is to be
                     re-used to install to. Using this will mean
                     that the installer will retain any existing
                     zvols or filesystems (datasets) already
                     existing.

                - is_root

                  This boolean flag defaults to "false". If set
                  to "true" then that zpool will be the one that
                  the new Boot Environment (BE) will be created
                  in.  A value of "false" is used to define a
                  data pool.

                - mountpoint

                  The mountpoint can only be specified for
                  non-root pools, and it sets the mountpoint of
                  the filesystem being created.  If a mountpoint
                  is not specified, the filesystem's mountpoint
                  is inherited from its parent.

             It is possible to set ZFS properties on the newly
             created zpool and the automatically created zfs
             dataset using the <pool_options> and
             <dataset_options> sub-tags.  The format of these
             is a simple name/value tag, and the properties that
             can be set are subject to the same restrictions that
             the zpool(1M) command enforces.  An example of how
             this works is:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <zpool name="rpool" is_root="true">
                     <pool_options>
                         <option name="listsnaps" value="on"/>
                         <option name="delegation" value="off"/>
                     </pool_options>
                     <dataset_options>
                         <option name="atime" value="on"/>
                         <option name="compression" value="on"/>
                     </dataset_options>
                     ...
                 </zpool>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             It is possible to influence how the Boot Environment
             is created during the install by specifying the <be>
             element.

             The <be> element has one attribute:

                - name

                  This will be the name of the new BE that is
                  created by the installer. It defaults to the
                  name "solaris" if the <be> element is not
                  specified.

                  The automated installer makes use of the
                  auto-naming feature provided by the boot
                  environment sub-system.  When installing into
                  an existing target area (for example, when
                  installing a zone), a boot environment with
                  this name may already exist, in which case this
                  name is used as a base to generate a new name.
                  For example, given a value of "solaris", the
                  resultant boot environment name may be
                  "solaris-N" where N is an integer.

             A Boot Environment is created as a ZFS dataset, and
             as such is capable of having ZFS properties set on
             it.  These can be provided by specifying the
             <options> sub-element as follows:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <be name="installed_be">
                     <options>
                         <option name="compression" value="on"/>
                         <option name="dedup" value="on"/>
                     <options>
                 </be>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             A zpool can also have any number of vdev redundancy
             groups, datasets or zvols define within it.  These
             are defined using the <vdev>, <filesystem> and
             <zvol> elements respectively.

             Virtual Device (vdev) Redundancy Groups

             A zpools size or structure is defined by using the
             <vdev> element.  You may have several <vdev>
             elements specified, each with different redundancy
             types.  The <vdev> element has several attributes:

                - name

                  This is the name for the vdev. This name can be
                  used in other elements' "in_vdev" attributes.

                - redundancy

                  none

                  This means that there is no redundancy, and if
                  multiple devices are included in this group
                  they will be striped.

                  mirror (Default)

                  This means that all devices contained are
                  considered mirrors of each other.

                  raidz raidz1 raidz2 raidz3

                  Any devices contained in a group with one of
                  these values will be used to define a RAIDZ
                  grouping.
         
                  spare

                  Any devices in this group will be seen as hot
                  spares should there be failures.

                  cache

                  Any devices used in this group will provide
                  caching for the zpool.

                  log logmirror

                  Any devices in this group will be used for
                  logging.  If "logmirror" is specified then the
                  devices will be mirrors.

               A root pool can only be defined as having one of
               the following configurations:
            
                  - a redundancy type of "none" with one device,
                    multiple devices are not supported here.
                  - a redundancy type of "mirror" with multiple
                    devices.

               To add a device to a <vdev> use the in_zpool
               and/or in_vdev attributes of a <disk>, <partition>
               or <slice> element (see above), for example:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                   <logical>
                       <zpool name="rpool" is_root="true">
                           <vdev name="mirrored" redundancy="mirror"/>
                       </zpool>
                   </logical>
                   <disk whole_disk="true" in_zpool="rpool" in_vdev="mirrored">
                       <disk_name name="c0t0d0" name_type="ctd"/>
                   </disk>
                   <disk whole_disk="true" in_zpool="rpool" in_vdev="mirrored">
                       <disk_name name="c1t0d0" name_type="ctd"/>
                   </disk>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
               would generate a root zpool called "rpool" which
               is mirrored over two disks.

               It is possible to omit one of the in_zpool or
               in_vdev attributes as long as there is no
               ambiguity in what they refer to.

             Filesystems (or Datasets)

                The <filesystem> element has several attributes
                that can be specified to define it:

                   - name

                     This defines the name for the filesystem,
                     relative to the zpool.  For example if the
                     filesystem is named "export", within a zpool
                     named "rpool" then the zfs dataset name will
                     be "rpool/export"

                     For filesystems with the "in_be" attribute
                     set to "true", this name is relative to the
                     boot environment's root dataset.

                   - action

                     The action attribute has several possible
                     values:

                        create

                        This value says that the filesystem is to
                        be created

                        delete

                        This value says that the filesystem is to
                        be delete

                        preserve

                        This value says that the filesystem is to
                        be preserved. This only makes sense if
                        the zpool itself is also preserved.

                   - mountpoint

                     This sets the mountpoint of the filesystem
                     being created. If a mountpoint is not
                     specified, the filesystem's mountpoint is
                     inherited from its parent.
            
                   - in_be

                     This defaults to "false" meaning that the
                     filesystem to be created is shared between
                     all Boot Environments. If this is set to
                     "true" then each boot environment will have
                     its own separate copy of this filesystem.

                Similar to the <dataset_options> it is possible
                to set the zfs dataset properties on a
                <filesystem>.  This is done using an <options>
                sub-tag.  For example:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                    <filesystem name="exported">
                        <options>
                            <option name="compression" value="off"/>
                            <option name="dedup" value="on"/>
                        <options>
                    </filesystem>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
                Note, as is the default behavior with ZFS
                filesystems, any property set on a filesystem is
                inherited by its children filesystems unless
                explicitly set otherwise.

             Zvol

                The <zvol> element is used to define a zvol
                within the zpool.  A zvol is typically used for
                swap or dump devices, but may have other uses.

                The attributes that are used with <zvols> are:

                   - name

                     This defines the name to be used for the
                     zvol.

                   - action

                     This attribute has several possible values:

                        create

                        This value says that the zvol is to be
                        created.

                        delete

                        This value says that the zvol is to be
                        deleted.

                        preserve

                        This value says that the zvol is to be
                        preserved.  This only makes sense if the
                        zpool itself is also preserved.

                        use_existing

                        If this value is specified for a swap or
                        dump device then the existing zvol will
                        be re-used.  This value only makes sense
                        if the zpool itself is also being
                        preserved.

                   - use

                     This attribute has several possible values:

                        none

                        This states that the zvol is to be
                        created, but not used for anything during
                        the install.

                        swap

                        This states that the zvol is to be
                        created and used as a swap device. It
                        will also be used as a swap device during
                        the install.

                        dump

                        This states that the zvol is to be
                        created and used as a dump device. It
                        will also be used as a dump device during
                        the install.

                Zvols may also have <size> sub-element to specify
                the size of the zvol.  See above for details of
                how the <size> element is specified.  An example
                of using the <size> sub-tag with <zvol> is:


                Similar to the <dataset_options>, it is possible
                to set the zfs zvol options on a <zvol>. This is
                done using an <options> sub-tag.  For example:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                    <zvol name="swap">
                        <options>
                            <option name="compression" value="off"/>
                        <options>
                    </zvol>
.fi

SOFTWARE SECTIONS

     It is possible to install software from a number of sources:

        - IPS Repository
        - P5I Specification
        - SVR4 Packages
        - CPIO Transfer

     The <software> element takes one of these values as the as
     the 'type' parameter, for example:

         <software type="IPS">
             ...
         </software>

     Depending on the mechanism for installing the software, it
     may be necessary to specify a <destination> and <source>
     element and several <software_data> elements. Each mechanism
     is discussed now in more detail.

     Installing using IPS:

        For IPS installs, it is only possible to specify a single
        <source> element. 
        
        The <source> element is usually used to specify which
        publishers to use for installing the packages.  You may
        specify multiple publishers, which may or may not have
        mirrors and/or more than one origin.

        The order that publishers appear in the manifest will be
        the rank order in which they will be set in the installed
        system.

        If installing into a zone, the system repository is
        always set to be used by the zone. Any publishers
        specified in the manifest will be added in the order they
        appear in the manifest, after the publishers provided by
        the system repository.  See pkg(1) and pkg.sysrepo(1M)
        for more information on the system repository.

        An example for specifying several publishers with a local
        mirror is the following:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <source>
                <publisher name="solaris">
                    <origin name="http://pkg.oracle.com/solaris/release"/>
                    <mirror name="http://localpkg.mycompany.com/solaris"/>
                </publisher>
                <publisher name="internal-software">
                    <origin name="http://internalsoft.mycompany.com/"/>
                </publisher>
            </source>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        The next item(s) to specify would be the actions to
        perform as <software_data> elements with an action
        attribute with one of two values:

           - "install" (the default value if not explicitly set)
           - "uninstall"

        (other values are not supported for IPS). For each of
        these actions, one or more packages may be specified
        using the <name> element, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <software_data> <!-- defaults to install action -->
                <name>pkg:/entire</name>
                <name>pkg:/group/system/solaris-large-server</name>
            </software_data>

            <software_data action="uninstall">
                <name>pkg:/unwanted/pkg</name>
            </software_data>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        It is possible to set properties, facets and SSL
        information on the destination repository, which is used
        in an IPS install, using the <destination> element and
        its sub-element <image>. 
        
        <image> has a few attributes which are:

           - ssl_key and ssl_certificate

             These map to the pkg(1) command -k and -c arguments
             respectively and are used to specify SSH related
             information to access the IPS repository.

        <image> has several sub-elements which are:

           - <facet set="true|false">FACET NAME</facet> 

             This allows the specification of facets which are
             used to limit some of the elements of a package that
             are installed.  A common use-case is to limit the
             locales, or be specific about the locales that are
             installed.  This can be achieved by using something
             like:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <destination>
                     <image>
                         <!-- de-select all locales -->
                         <facet set="false">facet.locale.*</facet>
                         <!-- specify specific locales to install -->
                         <!-- install German and English only -->
                         <facet set="true">facet.locale.de</facet>
                         <facet set="true">facet.locale.de_DE</facet>
                         <facet set="true">facet.locale.en</facet>
                         <facet set="true">facet.locale.en_US</facet>
                     </image>
                 </destination>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
           - <property val="true|false">PROPERTY NAME</property>
          
             This allows the specification of IPS properties to
             be set in the destination image. For further
             information on what properties can be set, please
             see the pkg(1) manpage.
            

     Installing using P5I:

        A P5I is a file that describes an IPS installation,
        including possible publishers, mirrors and packages.

        To specify one or more P5I files to be processed, provide
        them as origins in the <source>/<publisher> element.  For
        example:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <source>
                <image>
                    <origin>/somewhere/image1.p5i</origin>
                    <origin>/somewhere/image2.p5i</origin>
                </image>
            </source>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        With respect to the <destination> element, this behaves
        the same as for an IPS installation.

        Specification of packages to install via the
        <software_data> elements is not supported in this mode.

     Installing using SVR4:

        For a SVR4 transfer, it is necessary to specify a source
        directory for the packages to be installed in the new
        Boot Environment.
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <source>
                <dir path="/somedir"/>
            </source>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        The <software_data> element is used to specify the action
        to be performed.  The action attribute can be one of two
        values:

           - "install" (the default value if not explicitly set)

              Copies the files from the source to the new boot
              environment.

           - "uninstall"

              Removes the files from the new boot environment.

        (other values are not supported for SVR4). For each of
        these actions, one or more packages may be specified
        using the <name> element, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <software_data> <!-- defaults to install action -->
                <name>ORGpackage1</name>
                <name>ORGpackage2</name>
            </software_data>

            <software_data action="uninstall">
                <name>ORGpackage8</name>
            </software_data>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
     Installing using CPIO:
    
        For a CPIO transfer, it is necessary to specify a source.
        The destination directory will always be set to the
        mountpoint for the new boot environment during the
        install.
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
            <source>
                <dir path="/somedir"/>
            </source>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
        The <software_data> element is used to specify the action
        to be performed.  The action attribute can be one of
        three values:

           - "install" (the default value if not explicitly set)

             Copies the files from the source to the new boot
             environment.

             The files or directories to be copied may be
             specified using the <name> element - in all cases
             these are relative to the destination, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <software_data> <!-- defaults to install action -->
                     <name>path/relative/to/source</name>
                     <name>another/path/relative/to/source</name>
                 </software_data>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
           - "uninstall"

             Removes the files from the new boot environment.

             The files or directories to be removed may be
             specified using the <name> element - in all cases
             these are relative to the destination, e.g.:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <software_data action="uninstall">
                     <name>path/relative/to/destination</name>
                 </software_data>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
           - "transform"

             Executes a script with the source and destination
             directories as parameters, e.g.
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
                 <software_data action="transform">
                     <name>/script/to/run.sh</name>
                 </software_data>
.fi
.in -9
.sp
             would result in a call like:

                 /script/to/run.sh SRC DEST


BOOT CONFIGURATION

     As part of the AI manifest, it is possible to influence how
     the GRUB boot menu is configured on the installed system.
     This section is not applicable to zone installations and is
     ignored when installing a zone.

     Boot modifications are achieved using the <boot_mods>
     element which has a couple of attributes:

        - title
 
          This sets the title for the main boot entry in the GRUB
          menu.  This overrides the name that would be
          automatically generated from the /etc/release or
          install media.

        - timeout

          This sets the time to wait (in seconds) before the
          specialized menu item is selected.

     On SPARC, it is only possible to set the "title" attribute,
     all other settings in this section will be ignored.

     It is then possible to add multiple boot menu items using
     the sub-element <boot_entry>. These menu items are in
     addition to any automatically generated by the installer. 
    
     The <boot_entry> element has several attributes:

        - default_entry
      
          This boolean value defaults to "false".  If set to
          "true" then this menu item will be the default selected
          on boot. 

          If multiple entries set to "true" then the last entry
          will take precedence.

        - insert_at

          This defaults to "end", meaning that the entry will be
          placed at the end of the generated boot menu. It may
          also be set to "start" to place the entry at the start
          of the menu.

     The boot entry is then defined by providing the
     sub-elements:

        - title_suffix

          This is a required element, and defines text to be
          added to the end of the title specified in the
          <boot_mods> element.

        - kernel_args

          This is an optional string of values that will be
          passed to the kernel by the boot loader.
    

     An example of what this all looks like is:
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
         <boot_mods title="Boot Testing" timeout="20">
             <boot_entry default_entry="true">
                 <title_suffix>Default Boot Entry</title_suffix>
             </boot_entry>
         </boot_mods>
.fi
.in -9
.sp


OTHER CONFIGURATION

     The automated installer supports certain types of other
     configurations through the use of the <configuration>
     element.  At this time, the only configuration type
     supported are zone configurations.  When installing a global
     zone system, the zone configurations specified in the AI
     manifest will be used to install zones onto the system after
     the global zone has been installed.

     The <configuration> element has the following attributes:

        - type

          The type of configuration to install.  The only type
          supported by the automated installer is 'zone'.

        - name

          A name given to the configuration.  This name must be
          unique across all configuration elements in an AI
          manifest.  For configurations of type 'zone', this name
          is also used as the zonename for the zone.

        - source

          The location from which the automated installer will
          download the configuration file for this configuration
          element.  The value can be a HTTP or FTP URI
          specification.  For configurations of type 'zone', this
          value should point to a zone configuration file as
          produced from 'zonecfg export'.

     For example,
.sp
.in + 9
.nf
         <configuration type='zone' name='zone1'
             source='http://myserver.com/configs/zone1/config'/>
