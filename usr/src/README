Welcome to the mercurial source repository for the Caiman Project:
Slim Install, Distribution Constructor, Snap Upgrade and Auto Installer.
This source also includes the libraries needed for the Caiman Project.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To setup a machine for building this source repository:
-------------------------------------------------------
 1. Get the SunStudio compilers via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install
    run the command "pfexec pkg install developer/sunstudioexpress"

 2. Get the OS/Net Build Tools via the Image Packaging System (IPS). To install
    run the command "pfexec pkg install developer/build/onbld"

 3. Install required IPS packages:

	developer/swig
	system/boot/wanboot/internal
	system/library/install/libinstzones
	system/library/libdiskmgt/header-libdiskmgt
	system/zones/internal
	text/gnu-gettext

    To get these packages, run "pfexec pkg install <package>"

To setup the repository to be built:
------------------------------------
 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. cp tools/env/developer.sh .; chmod +w developer.sh.

    Some environment variables which might need to be changed:
    *You should - set the path to your repository defined by CODEMGR_WS.
    *You may - need to change the SPRO_ROOT variable to point to your
     installed compilers. Likely locations are:
	 /opt/SUNWspro
	 /opt/sunstudio12.1
	 /opt/SunStudioExpress (default)
    *If your compilers are not installed into /opt/SUNWspro, you will need
     to run the command "ln -s /opt/SunStudioExpress /opt/SUNWspro".
     For more information, see bug 11378:
        http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=11378

 3. Copy the nightly build script found in /opt/onbld/bin into the
    usr/src directory.

    cp /opt/onbld/bin/nightly .; chmod +w nightly

    In the nightly script there are three places
    where getopts is called. You need to add a "+" to two of them.

    while getopts +inS:tV: FLAG
                  ^
    and

    while getopts +0AaBCDdFfGIilMmNnOoPpRrS:TtUuWwXxz FLAG $NIGHTLY_OPTIONS
                  ^

    If you choose not to set these, you will see warning messages 
    regarding building tools. It won't affect your build otherwise.

    For more information see bug 849 -
    http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=849

To build this repository use the following steps:
-------------------------------------------------
 1. cd usr/src in the repository

 2. To build, run: ./nightly developer.sh
    This updates the source from the Mercurial repository.
 
    If you do not wish to do a Mercurial pull as part of the nightly run,
    use the -n option.

    ./nightly -n developer.sh
