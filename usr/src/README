Welcome to the mercurial source repository for Slim Install and Dwarf Caiman.

This source includes the SVR4 packaging tools, libraries needed for Caiman,
Dwarf Caiman, and the Slim install code. 

To build this source use the following steps:

 1. cd usr/src

 2. cp ../tools/env/developer.sh .; chmod +w developer.sh
    Change GATE and/or CODEMGR_WS as appropriate.
    You also need to set the paths for your build tools.

 4. source developer.sh

 5. run: ./opensolaris_build_slim.sh


Notes:

 1. Currently we are not able to build packages from this source.  

 2. The developer.sh file is used to build the current internal slim gate.
    Some of the variables defined in it are not relevant in the context of this
    repository.  Cleanup is needed to improve the  build process for the code in
    this repo.
