class SchemaData(object):
    '''
    Class which digests a DTD.  Presents methods for finding info on an
    element's children, and for printing out all information.

    It makes the following info available:
    1) What elements may follow a given element.
    2) Can there be multiple consecutive instances of an element with a given
       tagname?  (i.e. Does a quantifier ( * + ) follow the tagname in DTD?)

    This module makes the following assumptions about files/data it works with:
    1) Names of DTD files referenced within other DTDs contain only ascii
       characters.  They can start with a letter, colon or _.  Subsequent
       characters can be letters, numbers, .:_- .
    2) Each <!ELEMENT statement must be on a single line.
    3) A child appears only once in a given list of children.  (It may appear
       more than once, but only the first instance is recognized.)

        Recursively search the data structure for info about a child item.

        The search goes through three modes:
        1) SEARCHING: Search for the child item.  If a child happens to be
           listed twice, the first one found is the one info is returned for.
           Thus it is best that an element has only unique elements as
           children.  (Note: it does not matter if children reuse some child
           elements as grandchildren.)

        2) RETRIEVING: Look for and retrieve possible items which can
           immediately succeed the found item.  (Note: an item can represent a
           single element or a list of them.)

           If the next item is an element, then it is the only item returned in
           ret_list unless it's quanity is "?".  If the next item is a SEQ
           list, return only the first item of that SEQ list (unless that
           latter item's quantity is "?"), since that item will always follow
           the find_this item.  If the next item is an OR list, return all
           items in that list, since any one of them can follow the find_this
           item.  Of course, if the next item is a list, then it will be
           recursively traversed and processed.

        3) UNWINDING: Once all next items have been gathered, unwind recursion
           and return.

        Args:
          pt_list: the list to search through.

          find_this: the child to find information about

          search_state: Maintains state across iterations.

        Returns:
          The search_state object is modified as the routine recurses:

          - mode: changes state once item is found, and once all next-items
              have been gathered.

          - ret_list: holds references to all next-items as they are gathered.

          - mults_allowed: Set to True or False depending on whether multiple
            find_this elements are allowed in the children list.

          - first_list_gathered_from: reference to the list the first "next"
            item was retrieved from.
