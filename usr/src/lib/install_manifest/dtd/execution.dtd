	The name of a checkpoint is a unique to the registration instance.
	The mod_path is relative to the PYTHONPATH. The checkpoint_class
	is required so we can associate a checkpoint class with the
	mod_path which is a file that contains the checkpoint class. There
	may not necessarily be a 1-1 relationship.
