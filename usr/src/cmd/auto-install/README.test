AI service choosing engine (AISC)
=================================
Name of executable: /usr/bin/ai_get_manifest
Package: pkg:/install/installadm
Implementation: Python script

Purpose: Serves for obtaining AI and System Configuration (SC) combined manifest
from AI web server (please refer to AI design specification for more details)

Input: List of web servers to be contacted in format <address>:<port>,
Output: Obtained AI and SC combined manifest

[1] Test communication between AI web server and AISC
-----------------------------------------------------
* Prerequisites:
  - Running AI web server (please refer to AI web server testing
    procedure for appropriate information)
  - root privileges

* File containing list of services, e.g.
# cat ./service_list
ai-server.sun.com:8080

* Test procedure
# ./ai_get_manifest -s <service_list> -o <manifest>

* Expected output
ai_manifest file containinig combined AI and SC manifest
obtained from ai-server.sun.com:8080 web server

* Return codes
0 - success
1 - incorrect parameters provided
2 - manifest couldn't be obtained from given web server

[2] List criteria client knows and can provide to AI web server
---------------------------------------------------------------
* Test procedure
# ./ai_get_manifest -l

* Expected output
list of all name-value criteria pairs client can obtain information about

* Return codes
0 - success

[3] Run with increased debug verbosity
--------------------------------------
# ./ai_get_manifest -s <service_list> -o <manifest> -d 1-4

where '-d 4' enables the most verbose mode

AI service discovery engine (AISD)
==================================
Name of executable: /usr/bin/ai_sd
Package: pkg:/install/installadm
Implementation: Python script

Purpose: Tries to look up AI service which could provide AI and System Configuration
(SC) combined manifest valid for the client. Please refer to AI design specification
for more details - it can be obtained from Mercurial workspace
ssh://anon@hg.opensolaris.org/hg/caiman/caiman-docs - AI/ai_design_doc.odt file

Usage:
ai_sd [-s service_type] [-n service_name] [-t timeout] [-d debug_level] [-h] -o discovered_services_file

Input: Service name to look up, timeout
Output: List of AI server providing the service in format <address>:<port>

[1] Test of looking up 'named' service
--------------------------------------
* Prerequisites:
   -none

* Test procedure
[a] Publish service '_test_service' using dns-sd(1M) command
$ dns-sd -R _test_service _OSInstall._tcp local 8081 aiwebserver=tio:8081

[b] Run AISD to look up the service '_test-service'
$ ai_sd -n _test_service -o <service_list>

* Expected output
<service_list> file containing address of AI server in form
'tio:8081'

* Return codes
0 - success
2 - service not found

[2] Test of looking up 'default' service
----------------------------------------
* Prerequisites:
   -none

* Test procedure
[a] Publish service '_default' using dns-sd(1M) command
$ dns-sd -R _default _OSInstall._tcp local 8081 aiwebserver=tio:8081

[b] Run AISD to look up the service '_default'
$ ai_sd -o <service_list>

* Expected output
<service_list> file containing address of AI server in form
'tio:8081'

* Return codes
0 - success
2 - service not found

[3] Run with increased debug verbosity
--------------------------------------
$ ai_sd -n <service_name> -o <service_list> -d 1-4

where '-d 4' enables the most verbose mode
