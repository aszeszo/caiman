SELECT SLICE IN SOLARIS DOS PARTITION

This screen enables you to select a slice in a Solaris DOS partition to use for the installation. To indicate which slice to use for the installation, select the slice and change the slice type to rpool. You have the option of resizing the rpool.

The screen displays the existing slices in the Solaris DOS partition that you selected in the prior screens. The slices are displayed in the order that they are laid out in the partition. The current size and maximum available size for each slice are displayed.

GUIDELINES

* You can have only one rpool in the partition, and Oracle Solaris will be installed in the rpool.  

* The size of the rpool can be increased up to the maximum available size. When slices are shown as Unused, its available space is displayed in the available (Avail) column. You can change a slice to Unused, making its space available to adjacent slices.

Note: A red asterisk indicates that slice's content will be destroyed during installation. If the slice is not explicitly altered by the user, the slice content is preserved during installation.

HOW TO MODIFY SCREEN CONTENT

You can use any of the following options to modify screen content:

     * F5_Change Type - With a slice highlighted, press F5 repeatedly to cycle through the types until the desired slice type is displayed.

     * Size Fields - You can type changes in the size fields.

     * F7_Reset - Press F7 to restore all data in this screen to the original settings.

PROCEDURE

To exit this help screen, press F3. Then, in the installer screen, use the arrow keys to select the target slice if it is not already selected. If the selected slice type is not a rpool, press F5 repeatedly to cycle through the slice types until the type, rpool, is displayed. 

Note: Remember that you can have only one rpool in the partition. If another rpool exists, change its type to Unused before you change the targeted slice to a rpool.

OPTIONAL: You can make further optional modifications to the slice layout as described next, then press F2 to continue to the next screen. The changes you make will be implemented during the installation. To record layout changes, first use the arrow keys to highlight the slice that you want to modify. Then perform any of the following actions:

	* Delete a Slice - Press F5 repeatedly to cycle through the slice types until the type, Unused, is displayed. The space from an Unused slice is made available to adjacent slices.

	* Change a Slice's Type - Press F5 repeatedly to cycle through the slice types until the desired type is displayed. Use this procedure, for example, to change the type to rpool. 
	
	* Resize a Slice - If a selected slice's size is highlighted, you can resize that slice. Type the new size in the editable field, up to the maximum size available. 

	Note: The sum of the partition's sizes might not equal the size of the whole disk, because partition sizes are rounded to the nearest .1GB, and there might be unused space between partitions. 

	* Create a New Slice - Select an unused slice. Press F5 as needed to change the slice's type from Unused to another type, such as rpool. Slice 2, however, cannot be modified. 

Note: You can use the F7 key to cancel your changes. 

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to move through the text on each screen. If your keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
