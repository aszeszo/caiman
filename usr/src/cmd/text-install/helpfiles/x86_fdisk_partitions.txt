x86: FDISK PARTITIONS

This screen displays the fdisk partitions for the x86 storage device that you selected in the previous screen. 

Note: The partitions are listed in the order that they exist on the disk. 

PROCEDURE

To exit this help screen, press F3. Then, in the installer screen, use the arrow keys to highlight either "Use the whole disk" or "Use a partition on the disk". 

     * If you select "Use a partition on the disk," the next screens enable you to select which partition to use for the installation, and, if the partition has defined slices, which slice in that partition to use. You can also adjust the fdisk partition layout. 

     * If you select "Use the whole disk," the installer records that choice and proceeds to the next task.

       CAUTION: "Use the whole disk" erases the entire disk during installation. The disk is overwritten with the new Oracle Solaris OS. 

After making your selection, press F2 to continue to the next screen.

NAVIGATION

Use the function keys listed at the bottom of each screen to navigate between screens. Use the arrow keys to move through the text on each screen.

Note: If your keyboard does not have function keys, or the keys do not respond, press ESC to view the alternate ESC keys for navigation.
